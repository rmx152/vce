Water
	Universal solvent
		Due to its ability to form 4 hydrogen bonds and its high boiling and freezing points
	Can create a maximum of four intermolecular hydrogen bonds to four other water molecules
	When in its sold form, ice, it becomes a repeating crystalline structure with organised hydrogen bonding patterns 
	As ice is less dense than water, it will float
		This is due to its crystalline structure
	As temperature increases, molecules vibrate and move faster, overcoming the hydrogen bonds between them to move independently
	Group 16 hydride
		Bonds with 2 hydrogens
	Ocean acidification
		The decrease in pH of Earth's ocean due to increased absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

	Eutrophication
		  form of water pollution involving excess nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, leaching from soils, typically resulting in excessive growth of algae. The source of these excess nutrients is human activity (domestic wastewater, agricultural practices and sewage)
		When the excessive growth of algae and plants die, their subsequent decomposition seriously depletes the level of dissolved oxygen in the water. As a result of this, animals, especially fish, and even plants may die due to a lack of oxygen required for respiration. Additionally, all this decay may produce biotoxins, which can be a serious health hazard to any organism that consumes this water.
	Heat capacity
		Specific heat capacity
			4.18 j per gram 
			The measure of a substance's ability to absorb and store heat energy
			The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of energy required to heat up 1g of substance by 1 degree Celsius
			Water has a high specific heat capacity due to its strong hydrogen bonds
			Q = mCΔT
				Q = Energy required to make the heat change (in joules/j)
				m = mass of substance being heated in grams (g)
				C = Specific Heat capacity of substance
				∆T = Energy Change (Cº)
		Latent Heat Capacity
			q = n x L
				q = energy (in kj)
				n = amount in mol of substance going through phase change
				L = Latent Heat of Vaporisation (kj / mol)
					molar latent heat of vaporisation of water at 25 °C +44.0 kJ
					molar latent heat of vaporisation of water at 100 °C +40.7 kJ 
			The amount of heat energy required to be absorbed or released to achieve a phase change in a substance.
			When ice turns into a liquid, some intermolecular hydrogen bonds are broken.
			When liquid water turns into a gas, ALL intermolecular hydrogen bonds are broken
			So during a phase change, the energy being provided by the heat source is NOT going towards increasing the kinetic energy and temperature of particles - instead it is going towards breaking intermolecular bonds
