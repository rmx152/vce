Forming ionic bonds
	Ionic compounds are made with Cations and Anions
	Most often, they form between a metal and a nonmetal
	Metals and nonmetals are a perfect pair - metals have a high metallic character and want to lose their electrons, while non-metals have a high non-metallic character and want to steal electrons.

	How do we know the charge of an ion?
		A neutral atom has an equal number of protons and electrons, and so it has no charge at all. 
		Neutral atoms are rare though, since all atoms want to have a full valence shell of electrons
		Metals give away electrons to reveal the full shell underneath - this means they have more protons than electrons, and become cations
		Non-metals will gain electrons to complete their valence shell - this means they have more electrons than protons, and become anions

	Using the Periodic Table to Predict the Charge of Ions
		We can use the periodic table to help us predict what charge some ions will be - main group elements are easy to predict, transition metals are a bit harder
		The vertical groups in the periodic table are arranged by the number of valence electrons an element has, which determines what ion charge it will have.

	Electron transfer
		Electron transfer diagrams track the movement of electrons when atoms are forming an ionic bond
		Drawing them helps visualise what is happening when an ionic bond forms, how different ion charges develop, and why anions and cations are always in specific ratios
		We only show the valence electrons in these since it is only the valence electrons that take part in chemical reactions
			Please note - an electron transfer diagram is NOT the ionic bonding model - that will come later!

	Ionic bonding Model
		Every ionic compound contains cations and anions that alternate in their structure, so that no like charges are next to each other
		This means there is very strong electrostatic attraction in this lattice between the positive cations and the negative anions
		Ionic Compounds form a crystalline lattice structure (repeating arrangement of cations and anions)

Properties and structure of ionic compounds
	High Melting Point
		High melting point refers to a high amount of energy that is required to break ionic bonds. 
		The reason ionic compounds have a high melting point, is due to the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between cations and anions. 
		Therefore, a large amount of energy is required to break the electrostatic attraction between the ions.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QVMKEFwnJzhVYK8rnNb7l1CGD29Iia3YeCoqeg1-Hg9Ye79M3Yg0I6kRzcjiRLhUlDzsSuELKgjlS5Go_ncQVxPqIJF8stIs--BFjQAttIPAPHjPqE6y54AizXvBZJdaZK8kWSQNy05UNpzMZhlWhYIkDWXYhl32=s2048)
	Changing the ion charges and melting point
		Ionic bonds are strong so it takes a lot of heat to break them
	Hardness
		Hardness is a measure of how easily a substance is to scratch the surface of a material. E.g. diamond is the hardest material and can scratch most surfaces. 
		Why are ionic compounds hard?
			They are hard because there are strong electrostatic forces of attraction between cations and anions. 
			Therefore, a large amount of energy is required to break these bonds.
	Brittleness
		When a force is applied, the layers of ions will move relative to each other due to the force of the blow. 
		During this movement, ions of like charge are shifted so they are next to each other. The resulting repulsion between the similarly charged ions causes the crystal to shatter.
		![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wlZxkxUVvm2D0pPcJazS3vpWp-1xrPeg6V9Iqsi_tDBxvV154oZnZsOExE-aODy93T56_vBik40u1irlgOUzbunvMtpehrI0Fl4c6L4BVN76qyzW3yfpb8msIWJ6TR9d9431xOnTCMM1d2g6hQS1gCAqrmWlTw-K=s2048)
	Solubility
		Some ionic compounds are very soluble in water, whereas others are very insoluble. Whether an ionic compound is soluble or insoluble depends on the relative strength of the forces of attraction between the:
			positive and negative ions in the lattice 
			water molecules and the ions.
			Form stronger bonds w water -> soluble
			Insoluble -> strong ionic bonds w compound already
		![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PNQiP6g_uDDg05WGehZ8FdqV62q0M22ufYoNqg6kDonFMxROPEU2xxmUGwEDhM9FTm_FPfG7hwIhLyWkOMKWUc4c7hvRU06MPhfjJ3jtcJenAzxNxyI7GvYw8SFC7abpbrqJCt8fc5VLBmr8HRnsCBdoGlp-He1D=s2048)
	Electrical conductivity - Solid
		Electrical conductivity refers to how easily an ionic compound can conduct electricity.
		In the solid form, ions in ionic compounds are held in the crystal lattice. Electricity requires a flow of free moving charged particles. Cations and anions in a lattice structure are not free to move, so solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity. 
		![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2LKhhbVhk39Texkt6Yej-f-gdvcO2cTBhfvsJDKvTP4j9ZsgjCkBfLXkWoNribrr_yydqOnXa_RyBuNjv02xGf47Tfb1atd40IkkVK8ftYchoER-L72Ua9ezkBWfsVKlZUDZ3ewK6Tv8hY19aBHEkb-ECg1l706w=s2048)
	Electrical conductivity - Molten or Aqueous
		When the solid ionic compounds melt or are dissolved in water, the ions become free to move, enabling the cations and anions in the molten compound to move freely and therefore conduct electricity.
			 Not all ionic compounds are soluble in water
		![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ah8gT17bHqwumxLPRMrQ7MbHlaWjESatsPw2dyYYmqXQm52lGxz4PhYwTx86LibqAKELtm_DDq86QYuCRysG5GPTViOq1eWDBOLL3SXyua2a0oAgQ5icOFLtszO464gJ3gVmdVzWdRmY1nVi91UFLhlhxfi6TDlh=s2048)
	How can ionic compounds conduct electricity?
		As solids, ionic compounds cannot conduct electricity because their ions are bonded together in the lattice.
		When molten or dissolved in water the ions can break free of the lattice and are able to move. The ions are charged particles and so can carry an electric current.

	What is a solution? What is a solute and solvent?
		A solution is a homogenous mixture of two or more different substances where one is dissolved in another. 
	    When water is used to dissolve a solid, liquid or gaseous substance, an aqueous solution is produced. In an aqueous solution, particles can dissociate and move freely. 
	     Solute is the substance dissolving into the solvent. In aqueous solutions, water is always the solvent. 
	     ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AkgfztgpfY6FcH-Mh7rJvMdYSNkkL1QcwfX8dr_YzkFRO6UGb_zMb362NSqM3DuPPgdfL1HomIbGQgB4X5d-QmE-K4g43iTxZJcT3w85-cLhekudu208HojC6zReAbxaWtTAhIsV6y2ih8okU8LY0ZZQjiNpEXtH=s2048)
	What type of intermolecular forces are involved in a solution?
		When a substance dissolves, there are three different kinds of intermolecular forces that need to be considered:
			1. Intermolecular forces between solvent particles (H2O).
			2. Intermolecular forces between solute particles (ions in ionic compound).
			3. Intermolecular forces between solute and solvent particles (ions and H2O).
		For a solute to dissolve
			The solute-solvent (ion and water) intermolecular forces must be stronger than the solute-solute (ion-ion) and solvent-solvent (H2O-H2O) intermolecular forces. 
		![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FkXkLFdm5zT8kYZnyz7e02EquRyN0tltXm7I9xFHHrPwkV10yupIRMWSEHK8k7jH6UgIJZQpQlZIitUSQUAPsw-SbwOEfINM1vk69WOrd_q2XAQA-E2s3uDSyhOaNS4QX99d3Ng9bFxPYuem0tRIjaaMJO5YoMRZ=s2048)
	Insoluble ionic compounds
		Insoluble ionic compounds do not dissolve in water because the bonding between ions and their neighbors is too strong. 
		The possible ion-dipole bonds that could be created between ion and water molecules is too weak. 
		Therefore a bond between ions and water molecules are ions cannot be made, and so the compound stays insoluble. 
	The Solubility Rules
		![[solubility rule real.png]]
		![[solubility table.png]]
Precipitation reactions
	Double displacement reactions and Precipitation reactions
		Ionic compounds can take part in double displacement reactions, whereby the ions of two ionic compounds ‘swap’ their ions for each other. 
		A precipitation reaction is a type of double displacement reaction.
		A precipitation reaction occurs when two aqueous solutions are added together, and an insoluble solid precipitate is formed. 
		The aqueous solution left behind is called the supernatent
		![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KPAhAAArFFihGW2VBBaV0oNniH45_61Ph8rnqfawv_OXnT3kXt6ndzFoJwoliMUdIBEN3AmYaegRgxkGKzQlzdvCkEapfBcmv6r2dv1-F6LMjuymeEr2LdC9gRs_t1A5oqIBLqPwZ7dNDViXQlH07WgYKbENylle=s2048)
	Predicting if a reaction is a precipitation reaction or not
		Being able to predict the products of a precipitation reaction revolves around your understanding of the solubility rules.
			If an insoluble precipitate forms, a precipitation reaction occurs.
			If there is no insoluble precipitate formed, then no reaction occurs
	How do we write a precipitation reaction?
		1. Establish the products formed because of the exchanging of ions between the reactants.
		2. Write the chemical formula for each product.
		3. Check your states – is this a precipitation reaction?
		4. Ensure that both the reactant and product side have the same number of atoms of each element by balancing the full equation.
	Steps in Predicting a Precipitation Reaction
		Swap the ion partners and look at your solubility rules - is there a combination that forms an insoluble solid?
		![[precip.png]]
		![[pred.png]]
	No precipitation reaction

	Examples
		Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2KCl (aq) -> PbCl2 (s) + 2KNO3 (aq)
		Hg(NO3)2 (aq) + 2KCl (aq) -> HgCl2 (s) + 2KNO3 (aq)
		Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2KOH (aq) -> 2K(NO3)2 (aq) + Pb(OH)2 (s)
Ionic Equation
	So far, we have been looking at fully balanced precipitation equations
	Often, chemists want to zoom in on the details of what is happening in a reaction, to get a better picture of what particles are reacting and what particles aren’t taking part in reaction
	Full and net ionic equations are different way of writing equations and seeing what type of chemistry is happening
	![[ionic equation.png]]
	Examples
		Between sodium chloride and silver nitrate
			NaCl + AgNO3 -> NaNO3 + AgCl
			Ag + Cl -> AgCl
		Between sodium bromide and lead nitrate?
			2NaBr + Pb(NO3)2 -> 2NaNO3 + PbBr2
			2br + Pb -> PbBr2
		Between sodium sulfide and copper(II) nitrate?
			Na2S + Cu(NO3)2 -> 2NaNO3 + CuS
			Cu + S -> CuS
		Between iron(III) nitrate and potassium hydroxide?
			Fe(NO3)3 + 3KOH -> 3KNO3 + Fe(OH)3
			Fe + 3OH -> Fe(OH)3
