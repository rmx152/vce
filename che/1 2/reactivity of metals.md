![[metal reacticity.png]]All metals react by giving their electrons away. This depends on metallic character. The lower the metallic character is, the more stable it is, resulting in less reactivity.

When metals react with water
	Very few metals react with water as it is a stable substance
	Alkali metals and Alkali Earth metals react with water due to their high metallic character and reactivity
	These metals react with water to form alkali, a basic solution
	The base that is formed is known as metal hydroxide

Mg + 2H2O-> Mg(OH)2+ H2
2K + 2H2O -> 2KOH + H2
2Al + 6H2O -> (OH)3 + 3H2

When metals react with Acids
	Acids are more reactive than water, so many more metals with readily react with acids. ![[acids.png]]
	This is a type of neutralisation reaction. When metal is added to acid it turns the acid into a neutral salt solution and hydrogen gas. This is similar to metals reacting with water, however the salt solution left is behind is neutral, unlike metal and water reactions where it becomes acidic or basic.![[metal + acids.png]]


2Ca + 2HF -> 2CaF + H2
Mg + H2SO4 ->Mg(SO4) + H2
6Li + 2H3PO4 -> 2Li3PO4+ 3H2


Metals reacting with oxygen
	It is known as corrosion
	Most metals corrode, with varying speeds
	Metals have a strong metallic character ; they lose electrons 
	Oxygen Gas (O2) has a very strong non-metallic character ; it gains electrons
	When metals are in contact with the air for long periods of time, corrosion occurs as Oxygen steals electrons from the metal, turning it into a ionic compound![[metal + oxygen.png]]
