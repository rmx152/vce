Dissolution and chromatography
	Solubility refers to the degree to which one substance (the solute) can be dissolved in another (the solvent)
		Aqueous solutions 
			 formed when solid, liquid or gas dissolves in water
		Solute 
			substance being dissolved
		Solvent
			liquid in which substance dissolves
		One of the defining characteristics of a solution is that it is homogenous. This means that the solute and solvent are mixed and cannot be differentiated from each other. 
		For example, sea water is a solution of salt (solute) and water (solvent) because they are evenly mixed. 
		A mixture of sand and water, however, is not a solution because sand and water can be easily separated from one another.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/77kS4PpbNqcRIifg8EhGsYn3bxiVTs58UdJ_Y-fbMnb5PsqYN-INYRIwXykDk81SrSTSuBycELxgFnKO2CKqmAmfWsYx97HAbO1pj2NuwLptK1dBgB_iPXoyVSjo-ISJ8hv8wFFidLBEueuP6zPvgw=s2048)
	Process of Dissolution
		When a substance dissolves, there are three different intermolecular forces that need to be considered:  
			1. Intermolecular forces between solvent particles.
			2. Intermolecular forces between solute particles.
			3. Intermolecular forces between solute and solvent particles.
		For a substance to dissolve, the intermolecular forces between solute-solvent MUST BE STRONGER than the solute-solute and solvent-solvent intermolecular forces 
		What does it take for something to dissolve?
			If the forces of attraction between solvent particles or solute particles are stronger than the forces of attraction between the solute and solvent, then a substance will NOT dissolve
			If the forces of attraction between solvent-solute particles are stronger, then a substance WILL dissolve
			Solubility is affected by the following:
				Polarity
					Polar
						Forming hydrogen bonds with water(happens if it has H-FON within it)
						Forming ion-dipole bonds with water (happens if it does not have H-FON within it)
					Non-polar
						it can form dispersion forces with a non-polar solvent
				Number of hydrogen bonds
				Carbon chain length
				Complex molecules
					In general, the more polar the molecules of a molecular compound are, the more likely the compound is to dissolve in water. Some molecules have a polar section and a non-polar section, which makes it difficult to predict its solubility. In general, the larger the non-polar section of the molecule, the less soluble it is in water.

		Highly polar covalent molecules can ionise in water
			If a POLAR covalent compound does NOT have H-FON, but is still POLAR, it will form ION-DIPOLE BONDS. ![[chromatography-20240319120246449.webp]]
			When hydrogen chloride is added to water, the hydrogen atom in HCl forms a strong attraction to the oxygen atom in a water molecule that the Hâ€“Cl covalent bond breaks. 
			The two electrons that made up the Hâ€“Cl covalent bond remain with the more electronegative Cl atom to form a Cl- anion while the hydrogen ion (H+) bonds with the water molecule to form hydronium ion (H3O+). 
			The charged ions are then surrounded by other polar water molecules and held in solution by ionâ€“dipole attractions.
			These ions are said to be hydrated.

Chromatography
	Chromatography is a widely used technique for separating and analysing mixtures of organic compounds usually based on their polarity and size. e.g., drugs in blood.
	It is used to identify unknown components of a sample  (qualitative) or determine how much of a substance is present (quantitative).
	Types of Chromatography
		Paper chromatography
			Every type of chromatography has two starting components - the mobile phase and the stationary phase
			Stationary Phase 
				A fixed substance (either solid or liquid) within the chromatography setup. Separation of mixtures happens here. 
			Mobile Phase 
				A solvent that moves the sample through the column. It is important that the sample is soluble in the mobile phase (i.e. similar polarity)
			Adsorption vs Absorption
				Adsorption: Process by which the substance adheres to the surface of a phase
				Absorption:  Process by which a substance in drawn into the bulk of the phase

			How the stationary and mobile phases work together to separate a mixture 
				Chromatography always relies on two interactions to separate out compounds in a mixture: adsorption and desorption
					How soluble the molecules in the mixture are, and how easily they dissolve into the mobile phase ðŸ¡ªdesorption
					How attracted are molecules in the mixture to the stationary phase ðŸ¡ª adsorption
				The molecules that are very soluble in the mobile phase move faster.
				The molecules that are very attracted to the stationary phase move slower.
				This allows for separation of the molecules based on how they interact with the mobile phase and stationary phase

			Polarity in chromatography
			![[chromatography-20240321142727271.webp]]
				The molecule on the left is a constituent of yellow highlighter. The molecule on the right is a constituent of pink highlighter.
					Which one is more polar? 
						The yellow is more polar
					Which one would move faster and further in a paper chromatography analysis if the mobile phase is polar, and the stationary phase is non-polar?
						The yellow would move faster 
					What type of bonding would be present between the yellow and pink components and the mobile and stationary phases?
						They both will form the same bonds
			The polarity of the components of the mobile phase and of the stationary phase will dictate how strongly each component adheres to the stationary phase and how readily each component desorbs by redissolving in the mobile phase. 
			Therefore, the nature of the stationary phase, mobile phase and components in the sample's polarity is critical. 
			For example, if we have a polar stationary phase, we know that it is capable of dipole-dipole bonding. This means that if a component in the sample is also polar it will be strongly adsorbed to the stationary phase. Meanwhile, if we had a nonpolar component, it would desorb into the nonpolar mobile phase.

			As a result of the different polarity of the phases and components, each component will travel at different speeds, depending on what it is most attracted to. Therefore, a separation of components occur, and each component will take a different amount of time/distance to get through the column.

		Thin layer chromatography
			Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is similar to paper chromatography. In TLC, the stationary phase is a slice of cardboard with silica or aluminium oxide CRUSTED on top. There is no coating on them, it just looks like a thin layer of chalk has been PACKED onto the board. 
			This means they're very delicate, you can't bend them, and you shouldnâ€™t touch the stationary phase crust because if you chip it, you can ruin how well things can move through it/adsorb so it.
			Both paper chromatography and TLC are useful for qualitative analysis.
				Not all samples are naturally colourful â€“ so florescence is often used to allow them visibility in UV light 
			The components in a mixture can be identified by chromatography in one of two ways:
				By including standards of known chemicals on the same chromatogram as the unknown sample
					This method looks at comparing the spot of the unknown sample with that of a known standard. For example, suppose that you want to find out whether a lolly contains the sugars fructose and glucose. You could place a sample of the lolly on the same chromatogram as a pure sample of each of fructose and glucose (the â€˜standardsâ€™). 
					If spots from the lolly sample move the same distance from the origin as the spots from the pure samples, then the lolly is likely to contain the sugars.

				By calculating the retardation factor (Rf) of the sample - Rf value of a component can be compared to a set of standard Rf values but conditions must be the same. 
					Another way of identifying the components of a mixture is by calculating the distance they travel up the stationary phase compared to the distance travelled by the solvent front. This is expressed as a retardation factor (Rf) for a component: 
					The Rf value of a component is comparable to the set of standard Rf values, they must be determined under identical conditions.
