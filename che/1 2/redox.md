Redox Reactions and Oxidation numbers
	What is a redox reaction
		A redox reaction occurs when electrons are transferred from one species to another
		The important thing to remember is that the transfer is ALWAYS simultaneous - if one species is losing electrons, there must be another species there to gain them
		The formation of Sodium Chloride is a redox reaction - Sodium loses an electron, and chlorine gains that electron

			Oxidisation is loss
			Reduction is gain
		Oxidation 
			The loss of electrons
			Eg - Sodium has gone through oxidation/been oxidised - it has lost electrons

		Reduction
			The gain of electrons
			Eg - Chlorine has gone through reduction/ been reduced - it has gained electrons

	Redox Half Equations
		Since redox reactions are all about electron transfer, we are particularly interested in tracking the movement of electrons and showing where the electrons have come from and where they are going
		So we break down full redox reactions into half equations - one showing oxidation, one showing reduction
		![[redox-20240828114939084.webp]]
		Chlorine does gain an electron, but Chlorine atoms never exist as monoatomic particles - pure chlorine is always present as Chlorine Gas - Cl2.
		So we have to show two electrons being gained by each of the two chlorine atoms, to form two chloride anions
		This happens in reduction and oxidation reactions

	How many electrons

			1. Law of Conservation of Mass - Balance the Atoms on both sides of the equation
				![[redox-20240828115804892.webp]]
			2. Law of conservation of charge - The negatively charged electrons are used to make sure the charge on both sides of the equation is the same on both sides

	Oxidants and Reductants
		Oxidants
			Same as Oxidising agent
			particles that are gaining electrons 
			A species that causes oxidation, and is itself reduced
			![[redox-20240828120700709.webp]]
		Reduction
			those that donate electrons
			A species that causes oxidation, and is itself oxidised
			![[redox-20240828120733712.webp]]
		Combining half equations
			To combine equations, you have to make sure that the number of electrons are the same in each equation
			To do this, you multiply each half equation by a number to find the lowest common multiple of electrons

			Oxidation number rules
				1. The oxidation number of an ion is equal to the charge of that ion
					![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUccyOf8JbJ19nnN-RIIg9cgNFFZELwH_qmSZwdNAwisqJqLUX-mV0UPinly7s-NsGZoqiA50KWa6vff3Rgloh6VwCeTUR2Gh6y5Vcff5dXn24TPbWjKgqt2lSQjn0emXso1Uslc5g-ZmbqN0oHFEZejNxqIYxw=s2048?key=snu8dr-N36zj2JW33jh_CQ)
					Notice that we write the oxidation number above the element/atom. 
					We also put the =/- sign first and then the number - the opposite of how we write ion charges
				2. The oxidation number of pure elemental compounds is always 0
					![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUdH5zVlOVyDO40WKfcaPkfVeuF1Qkfna3WvdKsI676HU7EIyn3lV0kxeXOsm5ehReodPptizl9IQvpgSKXarGoO4iWiKZRDHhpSnHibuy7w2wYrXcEW-qfGTU-2EVOT9JxS_nMwzfu9Y5h1J_towbsCG0TnlkiO=s2048?key=snu8dr-N36zj2JW33jh_CQ)
					It doesn’t matter how many are bonded to each other - if it is just the pure element and bonded to nothing else, it has an oxidation number of 0.
					This is because
						No Transfer of Electrons
							In a pure element, there is no difference in electronegativity between the atoms since all the atoms are of the same type. Electrons are not transferred or unequally shared between atoms.
						Equal Sharing of Electrons
							Since atoms in a pure element have identical electronegativity, they share electrons equally. Therefore, there is no gain or loss of electrons, resulting in an oxidation number of 0.
					When in Aqueous solutions
						Presence of Different Species
							In an aqueous solution, elements are typically not present as pure substances; they are part of compounds or ions $$\text({NaCl},\text{H}_2\text{O},\text{Fe}^{3+}) $$The atoms in these species are bonded to atoms of different elements, which usually have different electronegativities.
						Unequal Sharing of Electrons
							 Because of the differing electronegativities, electrons in these compounds or ions are not shared equally. This results in a partial or complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another, leading to positive or negative oxidation states.
						Dissociation into Ions
						In aqueous solutions, compounds can dissociate into ions$$ 
						(\text{NaCl} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{Cl}^-)$$Each ion has a charge, and this charge corresponds to the oxidation state of the ion. For example, in$$ \text{NaCl}$$sodium has an oxidation state of +1, while chlorine has an oxidation state of -1.
				3. The sum of oxidation numbers must equal the charge of the compound
					This is how we find the oxidation number of atoms that do not have a rule related to them 
					The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound must equal zero.
					The sum of oxidation numbers for a polyatomic ion must equal the charge of that ion$$

\text{Compound} & \text{Element Oxidation States} & \text{Total Oxidation State} \\
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 & \text{Fe: } +3, \text{ O: } -2 & (+3 \times 2) + (-2 \times 3) = +6 - 6 = 0 \\
\text{NO}_3^- & \text{N: } +5, \text{ O: } -2 & +5 + (-2 \times 3) = +5 - 6 = -1 \\
\text{NaCl} & \text{Na: } +1, \text{ Cl: } -1 & +1 - 1 = 0 \\
\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-} & \text{Cr: } +6, \text{ O: } -2 & (+6 \times 2) + (-2 \times 7) = +12 - 14 = -2 \\
