Type of plastics
	HPDE and LDPE
		HPDE is high-density polyethene and LDPE is low-density polyethene, which is are examples of 
		These two polymers are made from the polymerisation of ethene monomers.
		Ethene is produced by steam cracking.
			Steam cracking is a process whereby larger hydrocarbons are extracted from crude oil, are mixed with stream and heated in the absence of oxygen to produce small, unsaturated hydrocarbons.
		HDPE use: milk jugs, detergent bottles, outdoor furniture and crates
		LDPE use: plastic bags and wraps
	PVC
		Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a widely used plastic made of chloroethane monomers.
		chloroethene monomers are created by reacting reacting chlorine gas with ethene, which is produced from crude oil in the cracking process.
		PVC use: pipes, electrical cable insulation, vinyl records and an alternative to leather. 
	PP
		Polypropene (PP) is composed of propene monomers and are produced by steam cracking larger hydrocarbons from crude oil.
		PP is flexible but rigid.
		PP use: packaging, bags, cars and textiles. 
	PS
		Polystyrene (PS) is composed of styrene monomers.
		This polymer is synthesized by dehydrogenating ethylbenzene (found in fossil fuels) and then polymerizing it to form polystyrene.
		PS is lightweight and soft.
		PS use: packaging, polystyrene cups and insulated boxes.

	Bioplastics
		Bioplastics are plastics produced from plant-based biomass and is an alternative to using fossil fuel-based plastics.
		Types of bioplastics
			Polylactic acid (PLA)- a condensation polymer
			Bio-PE (Bio-polyethene)- an addition polymer
			Bio-PP (Bi-propene)- an addition polymer
		PLA
			Polylactic acid (PLA) is a condensation polymer produced from the fermented plant starch from cops e.g. sugarcane or corn.
			Some of its properties include low melting point, high strength and good adhesive.
			Because of its properties, it is widely used as a filament plastic in 3D printing.
			Other uses include disposable tableware, cutlery, upholstery and clothing.
		Bio-PE
			Bio-polyethene (Bio-PE) is derived from plants and has the same formula as HDPE and LDPE.
			Bio-PE is made from ethanol, which is made from fermented plant matter (i.e. wheat and sugar cane)
			The ethanol is then dehydrated to produce ethene and polymerized to form bio-PE.
			The production of bio-PE is carbon negative because the crops used to produce bio-PE can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduces greenhouse gas emission.
			A disadvantage to producing bio-PE is that it causes land degradation.

		Bio-PP
			Like bio-PE, Bio-polypropene (Bio-PP) is produced from crops or vegetable oils.
			It is classified as a ‘drop-in’ bioplastic, meaning that it is chemically identical to fossil fuel-based polypropene

	Plastic recycling
		To minimize waste and demand for raw materials, it is important to regularly recycle. This includes collecting, processing and repurposing them inside into new items.
		How do we know if the plastic is recyclable?
			Each plastic has a recycling code, which is the number inside

		Recycling plastics method
			Collection
			Sorting plastics (automatically and manually)
			Washing
			Drying (to remove impurities)
			Recycling (mechanical, chemical and organic/ composting)
				Mechanical
					Mechanical recycling is the most common method of plastic recycling.
					Mechanical recycling involves shredding the plastic into small flakes and then melting and crushing them together to form pellets. The pellets are sent to manufacturers to make new products from the same plastic.
				Chemical
					Another method of recycling plastics is chemical recycling (advanced or feedstock recycling) where plastics are converted back to their polymer, monomer form or raw organic chemicals. This can be achieved in three ways:
						Plastic dissolution
							heating the plastic with solvents to produce a solution of polymers and additives which can then be separated.
						Chemolysis
							depolymerizing plastics by running chemical reactions to break a plastic up into its constituent monomers. You should note that this method can only be done with condensation polymers.
						Pyrolysis
							heating to 300-900oC in the absence of oxygen to convert plastics to raw organic chemicals and then used as fuels. However, this is an expensive and not a widely used method.
				Organic recycling 
					Composability refers to a substance’s ability to be broken down by microorganisms.
					Plastic composting is essentially organic recycling and relies on the plastics being biodegradable by naturally breaking down in the Earth’s soil.
					Disadvantages to organic recycling: may take million of years for the plastically to completely decompose and may lead to toxic residues or microplastics in the soil.
					Compostable plastics require high-temperatures in an industrial composter to break down. 
					The industrial composter controls the composting environment including its moisture, oxygen and heat level to maximise breakdown rate.
					Other ways to maximise the breakdown rate:
						Shred the plastic into smaller pieces
						React it with water at high tempt, to break it down into its monomer subunits.
						The bacteria will then decompose the monomer to produce H2O(g), CO2(g) and humus
		Considerations of recycling plastics
			Thermosets cannot be recycled while all thermoplastics can be mechanically recycled.
			Toxic contamination in the recycling process				
				It is important to note that not all plastics can be recycled safely because it can emit toxic products and lead to toxic contamination in the recycling process.
				Therefore, certain products like plastic food containers can only be recycled into outdoor furniture or plant holders.
			An expensive and resource consuming process
				PVC is an example of a difficult and resource intensive plastic to recycle, so not all recycling facilities recycle these types of plastics.
Circular economy
	The plastic economy
		![[plastics-20240529085515848.webp]]
		Considered a linear economy
		This is because producing new fossil-fuel based plastics is cheaper than recycling or making new renewable alternatives 
		In order for the plastics economy to be circular, it is important to consider the following things:
			Reducing wastage and efficiency e.g. converting one high-grade plastic to another must be close to 100% efficiency with minimal/no waste.
			The recycled plastic must be of similar grade compared to the original plastic.
			The biomass of the recycled plastic must be close to 100% conversion from the original plastic.
			Plastic residue must not harm ecosystems
Innovations in polymers
	Condensation polymerisation
		Polymer chains are made by condensation polymerisation whereby monomer constituents
		In condensation polymerisation, a hydroxyl functional group and carboxylic acid function react together, forming ester and water as a by-product, or a hydroxyl functional group and a amine function group react together 
		![[plastics-20240529091844396.webp]]
		PLA in a circular economy
			PLA is an example of a plastic that exhibits a circular economy.
			PLA is formed from the condensation of lactic acid monomers and is synthesized from naturally-occurring lactic acid obtained from the fermentation of sugar came and corn starch.
			PLA is used in the construction of medical implants e.g. screws or plates to fixate broken bones. It can last in the body up to 2 years before it breaks down and is naturally removed.
		PBS in a circular economy
			Polybutylene (PBS) is formed by a condensation reaction between an alcohol and carboxylic acid monomer, which is obtained from the fermentation of corn and wheat.
			It is a highly biodegradable plastic because it breaks down into biomass and water.
			It is widely used in packing applications because it is flexible, non-toxic and safe to package food.
	Hydrolysis
		A hydrolysis reaction involves the break down of a polymer chain into its basic monomer constituents by reacting the bond active sites with water.![[plastics-20240529092230985.webp]]
		Circular economy
			Because polymers can undergo hydrolysis reactions, it makes them biodegradable.
			Its ability to decompose is an important property to consider when transitioning from a linear to a circular economy. The quicker a polymer can degrade, the more beneficial it’ll be when they are re-used in the renewal of other resources and products.
