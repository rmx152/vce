Key terms
	Cation
		Positive ion formed when atom loses its valence electron(s)
	Crystal lattice
		Atoms of one type of metal that are metallically bonded and organised in a pattern
	Ductility
		Ability to be hammered or stretched into a thin shape without breaking
	Electrical conductivity
		Ability to allow an electrical current to flow through 
	Electrostatic attractions
		Attraction between opposite charges
	Heat conductivity
		Ability to allow heat to pass through 
	Lustre
		Shiny and glossy appearance
	Malleability
		Ability to deform under force without breaking 
	Metallic bonding
		The electrostatic force of attraction between delocalised electrons and cations in a metallic lattice structure 
	Ore
		Deposit in Earth's outermost layer containing metals and other minerals
	Sea of delocalised electrons
		Electron that move freely between metal cations in the metallic bonding model

Metals have metallic character - they prefer to give electrons away when they interact with other things
Metals have a low First Ionisation Energy, so it is pretty easy for metals to give away their valence electrons

First Ionisation Energy - How much energy is required to remove a valence electron 

Metallic bonding model
	The metallic lattice is held together by electrostatic attraction between cations and delocalised electrons
	This attraction is known by metallic bonding

Metal Recycling
	Resources are at risk of becoming scarce due to growing global population and rising prosperity levels
	Available resources therefore must be used as efficiently as possible
		A transition from a linear economy towards a circular economy is increasingly being adopted by society and industry as a strategy to achieve more sustainable development
	A circular economy
		 is when the materials and resources from a product are returned into the current economy which is a closed product cycle. 
	A linear economy 
		on the other hand is when a product is essentially disposed of in landfill after it has been used.
	Chemistry and its contribution
		The creation, use, re-use, disposal and elimination of chemicals should be achieved with the least possible adverse effects on human health and the environment while still providing economic and social benefits
	Green chemistry

			Processes/pathways should be designed to maximise incorporation of all reactant materials used in the process into the final product. 
		Use of renewable resources
			feedstocks: Raw materials or feedstocks should be made from renewable (mainly plant-based) materials, rather than from fossil fuels, whenever practicable. 
		Prevention of wastes
			It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it has been produced.
		Design for energy efficiency
			Processes/pathways should be designed for maximum energy. 
	Indium research
		Indium is often mined with other resources, and separated at refineries that are not equipped to manufacture indium. This results in transportation to indium refineries. This cost can be removed by adding indium refining capabilities to refineries of common metals that are mined alongside indium, such as zinc.
