	Metallic bonding
		The electrostatic force of attraction between delocalised electrons and cations in a metallic lattice structure 
	Ore

	Sea of delocalised electrons
		Electron that move freely between metal cations in the metallic bonding model

Metals have metallic character - they prefer to give electrons away when they interact with other things
Metals have a low First Ionisation Energy, so it is pretty easy for metals to give away their valence electrons

First Ionisation Energy - How much energy is required to remove a valence electron 

Metallic bonding model
	The metallic lattice is held together by electrostatic attraction between cations and delocalised electrons
	This attraction is known by metallic bonding

Metal Recycling
	Resources are at risk of becoming scarce due to growing global population and rising prosperity levels
	Available resources therefore must be used as efficiently as possible
		A transition from a linear economy towards a circular economy is increasingly being adopted by society and industry as a strategy to achieve more sustainable development
