Covalent bonding
	In Ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from a metal atom to a non-metal atom, whilst in Covalent bonding, electrons are mutually shared between two non-metal atoms.
	A covalent bond is a group of non-metal atoms chemically bonded together. 
	 The electronegativity of non-metal atoms is high: All want to gain electrons, but none want to donate. Therefore, this results in non-metals sharing electrons to satisfy the Octet Rule
	Therefore, a covalent bond is formed when a non-metallic atoms share electrons to fill their valence shell.
	A single covalent bond always contains two electrons - one from each of the two atoms participating in the bond

	Sharing electrons
		You can see the two electrons being shared in a molecule of hydrogen gas, with the chemical formula H2.
			Hydrogen gas is an example of a diatomic molecule because it is made up of two atoms covalently bonded together.
	Electron dot diagrams
		In an electron dot diagram: 
			the atom’s nucleus and all inner shell electrons are replaced by its element symbol. (Note: The inner shell electrons do not participate in the bonding.)
			he outer shell electrons (valence electrons) are represented by dots or small crosses around the symbol in a square arrangement.
		In the electron dot diagram for nitrogen, the two dots arranged as a pair represent non-bonding electrons or lone pairs. The three that appear as single dots (unpaired) are available for sharing and are called bonding electrons.
		![[dot diagram.png]]

		Steps
			1. Determine number of valence electrons an element has
			2.Determine the number of electrons shared by knowing that the number of electrons an atom needs is the number of bonds it will form

			Rule 1 - Count the number of bonds each atom should make
			Rule 2 - The atom that makes the highest number of bonds goes in the centre
			Rule 3 - Add lone pairs to complete the octet for the atoms that need one
			Rule 4 - Make sure that your molecule is drawn in the correct shape
				The shape of molecules is determined by a theory known as VSEPR Theory - or Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory.
				VSEPR Theory centers around the fact that electrons are negative and repel each other, so covalent bonding regions and lone pairs always arrange themselves so that they are as far apart from each other as possible.
					Lone pairs of electrons repel bonding pairs to a greater extent than a bonding pair repels another bonding pair.

	Polarity
		Uneven charge distribution in a molecule 
		A molecule is polar if it has 
			Polar bonds
			Asymmetrical
		A molecule is non-polar
			No polar bonds OR can have Polar bonds
			Symmetrical
		Polar bonds are when atoms have a difference in electronegativity between each other 
		When there are different atoms there is an imbalance in electron pull whereby the the more electronegative atom is δ– and the least is δ+. 
		 δ– 
			 Partially negative
		 δ+
			 Partially positive
		Non-polar diatomic molecules
			The two atoms in a covalent bond are the same (i.e. have identical electronegativities), then the electrons are shared equally between the two atoms. This is the case for diatomic molecules such as chlorine (Cl2), oxygen (O2), hydrogen (H2), and nitrogen (N2).
			Bonds with an equal distribution of valence (outer shell) electrons are said to be non-polar because there is no charge on either end of the molecule.

		Polar diatomic molecules
			When the atoms are not the same, there is a greater pull towards to electrons from the more electronegative atom. Therefore, here fluorine is more electronegative indicating that electrons tend to stay closer to the fluorine atom. 
			This imbalance in the electron distribution means the fluorine atom is partially negatively charged (δ–) and the hydrogen atom is partially positively charged (δ+). 
			The separation of the positive and negative charges is known as a dipole as they have two oppositely charged poles at each end of the molecule. We call this a polar bond.

		Shape of polyatomic molecules 
			Determining the polarity of molecules with more than two atoms is a little more complicated. 
			This is because the polarity of polyatomic molecules depends on the shape of the molecule as well as the polarity of the covalent bonds. As a rule: 
				A molecule is polar if it has:      
					Polar bonds
					Asymmetrical
				A molecule is non-polar if it has:
					Non polar bonds or polar bonds
					Symmetrical
			Establishing symmetry
				Symmetrical molecules
					The methane molecule is a perfect tetrahedron and is therefore symmetrical. The symmetry of the molecule means that the individual dipoles of the covalent bonds cancel out perfectly. The result is a molecule with no overall dipole. It is non-polar.  ![A picture containing object, clockDescription automatically generated](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lnwh5Y_ZocbyuwCuIWCGI5YuYRRT80CvMACdaHOTl8q_i-EG0AVKRqnSZo6JONMHZ8gOSufif9XmVC1A0XtsF2NO5ThMTCPQlX7xROq1WdHTjrZqTjHIPcFS0EjppwfLHf0Qnq6vPd2awwxEOqeMXkoQVoNi5J7l=s2048)
				Asymmetrical molecules
					In asymmetrical molecules, the individual dipoles of the covalent bonds do not cancel out. This results in a net dipole, making the overall molecule polar. ![A picture containing object, clockDescription automatically generated](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/k-EK9AK13-YVUdYCol1qgq2i9tsymAFYGSlOHjf5iGucEGmxZicucqTCqIDiSprN6NeMtriyO3ILXSg01KVmupGOnse5939aFY2DR-BLWugM9qDu68jZ1zakP3tp9YryN31lkJXgLnL4o4u-k1Swp19IGZG96URb=s2048)
	Intermolecular forces
		Forces between molecules
			Solid
				When water is in solid phase (ice) molecules are locked in place by their intermolecular bonds.
				The water molecules aren’t still moving - they actually vibrate in place when they are locked in this lattice. This vibration is known as kinetic energy
				![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FYgKwJ1aH6-59HS2JVV1KS5TxAFPXU3ttA8ProTX7uq75DIlaHIsnlpiII5AfGCHPyVgvGkqLwqlD6UJk3-kkrM8xkEbOsC52QPCqGGxM-XbLcRlYYqWu9hyNvQwZ_tMoVUU_myKPHLP2lC614eSasDpNYTMSIKX=s2048)
			Liquid
				To melt ice, we need to increase its temperature.
				When you increase the temperature, increases its kinetic energy (how fast it moves), breaking some of the intermolecular bonds. 
				In liquids, intermolecular forces temporarily form and break as the molecules move around each other and fill the shape of the vessel they’re in
				![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rtimF3wTYqdxObB_EQq2ox-soQgMdFs43-Vv_gvuH6-siHUP1gqtAj3ZaKRmvfh3KEJZQBMJUmepeGD5Iybb0a78ZuHs7IMWT3CDJG4QNcAN4Roo33h00Ql5pXC2XWJi3dEsKXHlXoETKH3mikebzND8TCxtETr5=s2048)
			Gas
				To turn water into a vapour, we need to give it more kinetic energy. 
				We must heat water (and provide it will so much kinetic energy) that all the intermolecular bonds between the molecules break
				Each molecule of a gas is moving independently of all the others, which is why they completely fill the volume of space they are given
				![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2ug3FNgEsP_9L_eEDDd_QkJZwbzhHUFSG6Be8gEgSNyh41CYPAHpwb_FQU1fD7r7r9hI90_fvxSlcAHCdmnDBU38RROZaRVK-BR_yLx_pGvTrHDJvr43ukf_ljWN7syH3Cxq0_EziV8b6VRAGrftgGv9kR2e89Ac=s2048)
		Intramolecular bonds
			Forces inside a molecule
			Often strong
		Intermolecular bonds
			Forces between molecules
			Often weak
				The type of intermolecular bonds present between molecules determines how much energy is required to break those bonds, and therefore the melting and boiling point of a molecule
			Types
				dipole-dipole forces
					All polar molecules are capable of Dipole - Dipole Bonding.
					Dipole Dipole Bonding is the result of electrostatic attraction between permanent dipoles in polar molecules
					![[dipole dipole.png]]
				hydrogen bonding
					Hydrogen bonding is a stronger type of dipole dipole bonding.
					Hydrogen bonds MUST occur between H-FON and its lone pair.
					Hydrogen bonds are stronger than regular dipole dipole bonds is because they have a much larger electronegativity difference between the dipoles. This larger difference makes the electrostatic attraction between dipoles much stronger  ![[hydrogen bonding.png]]
				dispersion forces
					occur in both polar and non-polar molecules
					Weakest type of bonding 
					Electrons move randomly and quickly around the nucleus
					At some instance's electrons may be found closer to one end of a molecule producing an instantaneous dipole
					![[dispersion forces.png]]
					![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hN_Z_VuohJRJUzqWyjqUbmeiy1MNBjOHInGF-xtpaaeIbalvl6C7DLl1MD9bDO9LU-YriCWYrALD2Mo6dCski6diMOnEh03qLcG8sGDw9xhpIkA7z4nY7zIDC68kyrvostqABFcrnyTkwtdr_I8dsBB5JNhQnHxY=s2048)
					An instantaneous dipole in one molecule will induce an instantaneous dipole of opposite charge in an adjacent molecule, creating a force of electrostatic attraction between two molecules. 
					This happens millions of times across millions of atoms, creating dispersion forces.  
					The more electrons a molecule has, the more the instantaneous dipoles the stronger the dispersion forces.

				Ion-dipole bonds
					Ion dipole bonds are very important for when we start looking at how certain substances dissolve in different solvents.
					When ionic substances dissolve in water, the ions dissociate (break up).  They then form ion-dipole bonds with the permanent dipoles on the water molecules are attracted to the opposing charged ion via electrostatic attraction. ![[ion dipole.png]]

				![[summary intermolecular bonds.png]]
		The effect of heat on water and its bonding
			the INTRAMOLECULAR bonds are not broken. It is the bonds between water molecules that is broken (the intermolecular bonds)
			Different molecules have different melting and boiling points because they have different types of intermolecular bonds - There are stronger intermolecular bonds and weaker intermolecular bonds. 
			The stronger the intermolecular bond, the more energy, therefore a higher temperature, is required to break it and cause a substance to melt or evaporate
			A weaker intermolecular bond is easier to break, and so a lower temperature is needed to cause a substance to melt or evaporate
	Properties of covalent compounds

		Melting point/boiling point
			Melting point refers to heating a covalent compound for it to break some of their intermolecular forces to change from a solid to liquid state. 
			Boiling point refers to heating a covalent compound for it to break all their intermolecular forces to change from a liquid to gaseous state. 
			Polarity
				In your response refer to:
					Polarity of each molecule
					The intermolecular forces that will be between each molecule
					Which intermolecular force is stronger/weaker
					How this relates to how much energy is required to break the molecules from each other 🡪 BP
			Size
				The size of a molecule can determine the strength of intermolecular forces.
				As the molecule becomes larger and has more electrons, this increases its capacity to form more instantaneous dipoles which increases the strength of the dispersion forces 🡪 greater boiling point
			Shape
				The shape of a molecule can also impact its boiling point. 
				Molecules that are linear in shape can form more dispersion forces as groups of atoms can pack closely together . This means they will have stronger intermolecular forces. 
				Molecules that form branches cannot pack as closely and form weaker intermolecular forces (as they cannot form as many dispersion forces)
				![SchematicDescription automatically generated](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jyR-VYbwgtqXJl-tt02N-MLwSbm4gS_sKdsgyMyly-irDpIT1cTmon-mBuZvy0Uiunel3jy28IippvuGVGXSkq2wst4Lgcsj5dcSN7vE105FycbxRpmGA9wpf4rdX-1Exp4xmy-Y_L7BKom2CQc7CJuq3HJrPwJv=s2048)
		 Solubility 
			 Solubility refers to a compounds ability to dissolve in water or another solvent based on its polarity. 
			 In general, substances that are polar tend to dissolve in polar solvents. Non-polar substances tend to dissolve in non-polar solvents.
			To determine solubility for covalent compounds:
				Determine the solute and solvents polarity
				If polarities are the same, determine the type of intermolecular forces that would form between the molecules. 
					DO NOT: just indicate that “like dissolves like”
			Example
				Will CH4 dissolve in ethane (C2H6)? Why/why not?
					CH4 and C2H6 are both non polar
					CH4 forms dispersion forces with C2H6, therefore soluble
				Will CH4 dissolve in water (H2O)? Why/why not?
					CH4 is non-polar whereas H2O is polar
					As polarity differs molecules will not be soluble in each other
				Will CH3Cl dissolve in water (H2O)? Why/why not?
					CH3Cl and H2O are both polar
					CH3Cl con form dipole-dipole bonds between the H2O molecule, therefor soluble
				Will NH3 dissolve in water (H2O)? Why/why not?
					NH3 and H2O are both polar molecules
					Therefore they will have hydrogen bonds between each other, therefore soluble
		 Non-conductivity 
			 Covalent compounds do not conduct electricity; this is because covalent compounds do not have charged particles capable of transporting electrons.
