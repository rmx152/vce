Covalent bonding
	In Ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from a metal atom to a non-metal atom, whilst in Covalent bonding, electrons are mutually shared between two non-metal atoms.
	A covalent bond is a group of non-metal atoms chemically bonded together. 
	 The electronegativity of non-metal atoms is high: All want to gain electrons, but none want to donate. Therefore, this results in non-metals sharing electrons to satisfy the Octet Rule
	Therefore, a covalent bond is formed when a non-metallic atoms share electrons to fill their valence shell.
	A single covalent bond always contains two electrons - one from each of the two atoms participating in the bond

	Sharing electrons
		You can see the two electrons being shared in a molecule of hydrogen gas, with the chemical formula H2.
			Hydrogen gas is an example of a diatomic molecule because it is made up of two atoms covalently bonded together.
	Electron dot diagrams
		In an electron dot diagram: 
			the atom’s nucleus and all inner shell electrons are replaced by its element symbol. (Note: The inner shell electrons do not participate in the bonding.)
			he outer shell electrons (valence electrons) are represented by dots or small crosses around the symbol in a square arrangement.
		In the electron dot diagram for nitrogen, the two dots arranged as a pair represent non-bonding electrons or lone pairs. The three that appear as single dots (unpaired) are available for sharing and are called bonding electrons.

		Steps
			1. Determine number of valence electrons an element has
			2.Determine the number of electrons shared by knowing that the number of electrons an atom needs is the number of bonds it will form

			Rule 1 - Count the number of bonds each atom should make
			Rule 2 - The atom that makes the highest number of bonds goes in the centre
			Rule 3 - Add lone pairs to complete the octet for the atoms that need one
			Rule 4 - Make sure that your molecule is drawn in the correct shape
				The shape of molecules is determined by a theory known as VSEPR Theory - or Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory.
				VSEPR Theory centers around the fact that electrons are negative and repel each other, so covalent bonding regions and lone pairs always arrange themselves so that they are as far apart from each other as possible.
				Lone pairs of electrons repel bonding pairs to a greater extent than a bonding pair repels another bonding pair.

					Carbon dioxide does not contain 1 bonding pair and 3 lone pairs. However, it is linear because it has 2 =‘s, to create maximum separation it must adopt a linear shape
