Polymer
	A polymer is a massive molecule produced from huge numbers of repeating subunits known as monomers 
	Monomers 
		small molecules that are the repeating building blocks of a polymer
	Types of polymer
		Addition Polymerisation
			Addition polymerisation requires monomers to have a C=C bond (alkenes)
			In high temperatures with a catalyst, the C=C bond in the monomer is broken, and they instead bond to each other to form a long polymer chain

		Condensation Polymerisation
			Condensation polymerization is involved monomers reacting together to form long polymer chains
			A condensation reaction is a category of reaction that occurs when water is formed as a product.
			Condensation Polymerisation requires monomers with functional groups that can participate in condensation reactions

		Copolymer
			Copolymers are polymers that are composed of more than one type of repeating monomer subunit.
			The different monomers might be arranged in a regular, alternating pattern, or rand andomly.

Linear Polymers and Cross-linked Polymers
	Changing the Structure of Polymer Chains
		One of the first ways a chemist can change the properties of a polymer is change the degree of branching in the polymer.
		More branching decreases the density, which makes it softer and more flexible
		Less branching increases the density, making a polymer harder and less flexible![[polymers-20240523085404455.webp]]
	HDPE and LDPE
		HDPE - High Density Polyethylene
		LDPE - Low Density Polyethylene
		Polyethylene is a very common plastic used in society, made out of ethene monomers.
		While HDPE and LDPE are made with the same monomer, the degree of branching really changes the properties and thus the possible uses of polyethylene

	Adding Crosslinks to Polymer Chains
		Chemists can also add crosslinks between different polymer chains.
		Crosslinks make a plastic much harder and less flexible plastics without crosslinks

	Thermosetting and Thermosoftening Polymers
		Polymers without crosslinks are known as thermosoftening or thermoplastic polymers. They melt when heated, and can be remoulded into something new
		Polymers with crosslinks are known as thermosetting polymers, and they burn and char when heated - they cannot be melted and remoulded into something new.

	Plasticizers and Elastomers
		Plasticizers
			Molecules that sit in between polymer chains forcing them further apart. They make a plastic more flexible and mouldable.
			![[polymers-20240523085902673.webp]]
		Elastomers
			These are cross-links that make a polymer elastic. They allow it to be stretched and bounce back into its original form. Think of rubber bands and bouncy balls

		Changing the Intermolecular Bonds in Polymers
			Monomers have different polarities - some are polar, some are non-polar, some are attracted to each other through hydrogen bonds, some can only bond through dispersion forces.
			Identify the polarity of the following monomers and what intermolecular bonds they are capable of
			![[polymers-20240523091747345.webp|396]]
		How monomers change the properties of different polymers
			The stronger the intermolecular bonds between polymer chains, the harder and less flexible the plastic can be. 
			![[polymers-20240523091822273.webp]]
		Length of polymer chains
			Polymers with longer chains tend to be harder/stronger and less flexible; they can withstand higher temperatures before they soften or melt.
			Longer polymer chains are larger molecules. This means that the dispersion forces between chains are stronger. Additionally, the longer polymer chains are, the more they become tangled. 
			They are also less likely to slide over each other than smaller chains. These features mean that it is harder for the chains to move with respect to one another.
				LDPE has many long side branches and is soft, flexible and translucent, with a waxy surface.
				HDPE has shorter and fewer branches and is more rigid, stronger and more opaque.
		Degree of branching
			A linear polymer may, therefore, be more accurately thought of as branches on a tree. As a general rule, the more extreme the conditions required for polymerisation, the greater the number and length of such side branches. This phenomenon is illustrated by polyethene.
			Ethene can be polymerised to produce both low- and high-density polyethene. 
			Low-density polyethene (LDPE) thermoplastic polymer with a large number of side branches produced from the monomer ethene.
			Its polymer chains support many long side branches, producing a low-density substance. As the only forces causing these polymer chains to attract each other are dispersion forces, the effect of the branches is to keep the chains apart. Because the attraction becomes weaker as the chains are further apart, the density of the resultant compound is low, and LDPE is soft, flexible and translucent, with a waxy surface that repels water. 
		High-density polyethene (HDPE)
