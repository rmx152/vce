Electron configuration 

Oxygen
1s2s2p

Calcium
1s2s2p3s3p4s

Iron 
1s2s2p3s3p4s,3d6

Chromium 
1s2,2s2,2p6,3s2,3p6,4s1,3d5

Chromium and Copper are exceptions because sub shells are more stable half filled, so instead of 4s2 its 4s1 to achieve a half subshells of 3d5

Categories
	Group 1 are alkali metals
		Have 1 valence electron
		Reactive
		When they are added to water they form a base (alkali)
	Group 2 are alkali earth metals
		2 valence electrons 
		Less reactive than alkali metals
		Elements form Earth's crust
	Group 3-12 are transition metals
		Transition between ionic charges (Cannot tell from group)
	Group 17 are halogens
		All are non-metals
		Seven valence electrons
		Very reactive, close to full shell
		When in elemental form the form diatomic gasses
	Group 18 are Noble Gases
		They all have full valence shells
		Unreactive 

Exceptions
	Hydrogen does not act like a group 1 metal (it does not lose electrons)
	Helium is placed in group 8 because it is completely stable (full valence shell)

Core charge
	How strong the pull of the atom's nucleus is on its valence electrons
	As atomic number increases the number of positive protons increase
	The means that the electrostatic attraction between positive nucleus and the negative electrons is stronger, pulling in the electron shells closer to the nucleus
	It is always a positive value
	Core charge is equal to number of protons in the nucleus - the number of total inner shell electrons (it is the number of valence electrons)
	Core charge remains the same across a group, however valence electrons are weakly attracted as atomic radius increases
	Core charge increases across a period

Electronegativity
	Ability of an atom to attract electrons towards itself
	Greater the electronegativity the more readily the atom will attract an electron
	Electronegativity predicts the reactivity of an atom, the type of bonds, and the properties of larger molecules with multiple elements
	Electronegativity increases across a period, as core charge also increases. The impact this has it that the stronger the core charge, the stronger the atom attracts valence electrons to form a full valence shell.
Core charge v Electronegativity
	Core charge is the strength of attraction between the positive nucleus and the valence electrons of that atom
Atomic radius
	Influenced by
		Core charge
		Number of shells
	Decreases across a period
	Increases down a group
	This is occurring as there are more shells down a group increasing the atomic radius, and the core charge does not change, not affecting the attraction of valence electrons, whereas across the period the atomic radius decreases as the core charge is greater, which results in a greater attraction towards the nucleus, resulting in a smaller atomic radius.
Ionisation energy
	The amount of energy required to remove an electron form an atom or ion
	The higher the ionisation energy, the harder it is to remove an electron
	Removing electrons turns an element into a positive ion (cation)
	This is because electrostatic attraction is much higher closer to the nucleus, requiring more energy to remove those electrons from orbit
	Increases across a period
	Decreases down a group
	As core charge remains the same down a group, the attraction of the valence electrons due to core charge is much weaker due to a larger amount of shells, hence ionisation energy decreases down a group. Ionisation energy increases across a period due to the core charge increasing, causing elements to be much more stable and therefore requiring more ionisation energy.
Metallic and Non-Metallic Character
	Metallic character : The tendency of an element to lose electrons (because of their lower core charge)
	Non-Metallic Character : The tendency for an element to gain electrons (because of their higher core charge)
	These trends indicate how atoms are likely to behave in different chemical reactions
	Reactivity of metals
		Down a group, core charge remains the same however number of shells increases, resulting in less attraction of valence electrons from the nucleus due to a larger atomic radius, increasing reactivity. Across a period core charge increases, resulting in a stronger attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus, decreasing metal reactivity as elements would be less likely to lose electrons. 
	Reactivity of Non-metals
		As core charge remains the same down a group however the attraction of valence electrons to the nucleus is weaker, therefore they are less likely to gain electrons. As core charge increases across a period, the attraction of valence electrons to the nucleus is stronger, therefore they are more likely to gain electrons.
