Acids and Bases
	Acids
		Acids are proton donors
		Protons are hydrogen ions (H+)
		Acids give away one or more of hydrogen ions
		![[acids base reactions-20240620085728863.webp]]
	Bases
		Bases are proton accepters
		Bases gain any protons floating in a solution
		![[acids base reactions-20240620085823667.webp]]
	Chemical action of acids
		Water is the solvent and acid is the solute
		If acids are in a solution, then they donate their proton to water
		This forms a ion called a hydronium ion
	The hydronium ion
		Acidic refers to the concentration of hydronium ions in it
		The more acidic a solution is, the higher the concentration of hydronium ions are in the solution
		![[acids base reactions-20240620092920977.webp]]
	Monoprotic and Polyprotic acid
		Monoprotic acids have one acidic proton to give away
		Polyprotic acids have two or more acidic protons to give away
		If an acid has two acidic protons, it is called diprotic
		If an acid has three acidic protons, it is called triprotic
		Monoprotic acids

		Triprotic acids

		![[acids base reactions-20240620102608663.webp]]
		Chemical equations of Mono vs Polyprotic Acids
			Acids give protons away to water but a water molecule can only accept one proton/hydrogen ion
			This means that polyprotic acids need to give away protons in steps to different water molecules

	The action of bases
		Bases are proton acceptors
			They gain protons
		When bases take a proton from water, it forms a hydroxide ion
		![[acids base reactions-20240624115203121.webp|415]]
		The hydroxide ion
			The more basic a solution is, the higher the hydroxide ion concentration
			By referring to a solution as basic, it refers to the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution
		The different actions of bases
			Hydroxide ions are bases
				Proton accepter
			Hydronium ions are acids
				Proton donor
			![[acids base reactions-20240624115514935.webp]]
			Disassociation
				![[acids base reactions-20240624115423479.webp]]
		Amphiprotic substances
			Receiving and donating protons is reversible
			The substances that have the ability to become protons donors or proton receivers are considered amphiprotic
				Water is an example

Neutralisation reactions to produce salts
	Acid and metal hydroxides
		Metal Hydroxides are ionic compounds, with a metal cation and a hydroxide anion
		![[acid base reactions-20240624120605801.webp|213]]
		All metal hydroxides are bases, since they dissociate to form hydroxide ions, which makes a solution basic
		![[acid base reactions-20240624121223348.webp|341]]
		It is the hydroxide ion that will accept the proton that the acid donates
		![[acid base reactions-20240624121252165.webp|350]]
		When an acid is added to a metal hydroxide, the acid donates its proton, and the hydroxide ion accepts it, forming water
		The other ions - the anion of the acid and the metal cation in the metal hydroxide form a salt - another term for an ionic compound. 
		![[acid base reactions-20240624121409491.webp|472]]
	Balancing Neutralisation Reactions
		 diprotic acid donates two protons, but Sodium Hydroxide only gives off one hydroxide ion		
		Therefore, it needs two Sodium Hydroxides to neutralise every one Sulfuric Acid

	Acids with metal carbonates
		A metal carbonate is an ionic compound - a Metal Cation bonded to a Carbonate Anion
		![[acid base reactions-20240624122948006.webp]]
	Antacid
		Antacids compose of bases to neutralise the  the Hydrochloric Acid rising from the stomach.
		Acid reflux is caused temporarily by stomach acid moving into the oesophagus
		![[acid base reactions-20240624123936928.webp|760]]
		Antacids do not treat acid reflux, they only lessen the symptoms
Concentration
	Measure of how much solute there is in a measured amount of solvent
	Concentration formula
		c = concentration in M (mol/L)
		n = amount in mol of solute
		v = Volume in Litres of solvent

Strong v weak acids and bases
	The idea of reversible giving and taking of protons also helps us understand why some acids are considered strong, and some are considered weak
	Strong acids ALWAYS donate their protons, 100% of the time
	Weak acids only donate their protons SOMETIMES. 
	Strong Acids
		Hydrochloric acid (HCl) 
		When HCl is added to water, it dissociates 100% of the time
		HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl-
	Weak Acids
		weak acids often take their protons back after dissociating
		So to distinguish between strong and weak acids, we use a reversible arrow, to show that the reaction goes backwards as well as forwards
		CH3COOH + H2O ⇌  H3O+ + CH3COO-
	Strength v concentration
		cannot be used interchangeably
		Strength is a measure of how likely it is for an acid to donate a proton, or how likely it is for a base to accept a proton. 
		Concentration is a measure of how many acid or base particles are present in the first place
Concentration
	tell us how many particles are present per unit volume.
	The most common unit of concentration we use in chemistry is Molar Concentration (M).
	It measures how many moles of particles are present per litre of water (mol/L)
pH Scale
	way of referencing the Hydronium ion/proton concentration of a solution. 
	pH decreases as concentration of H+ increases
	The Autoionisation of water
		 25oC is the standard temperature in chemistry ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUd6PxRHFvTAgnjslLkeqOcvUXYhjpOWO9gT7sSKwbDouWwJ_HyOcsiQsCQn7qXeiWpS_z_GT26rg-LwY3UP2hR_DO0qLPCmqXVgVDd1wOkEsqzq5or-hXOfUXbeT1b5c6cohoToUGh7a8-GWULVyTzafSFIBms=s2048?key=-zP6FfT034wG0amFXy8SyQ)
		 The ionic product of water shows that at 25oC, the concentration of OH- and H3O+ ions will ALWAYS equal 10-14 in ANY solution
	How to calculate pH
		pH = -log(H3O+)
		(H3O+) = 10-pH
