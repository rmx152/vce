Hydrocarbon families
	Organic chemistry is the study of carbon based components
	Why is it carbon based?
		It always makes four covalent bonds
		It is good at making complex chains and macromolecules

			Structural formula

			Alkane formula
				C(n)H(2n+2)
				n = number of carbons
			Semi-structural formula
				Semi-structural formula derived from the structural formula that shows the grouping of atoms in a molecule, carbon by carbon, and is written as a single line of text
					 also called a condensed formula

			Reactions of alkanes
				Combustion reactions

				Substitution reactions
					Reaction in which a group of atoms is removed and replaced by another atom
					One or more fluorine or chlorine atoms take the place of one or more hydrogen atoms
						This creates haloalkanes
					![[families of organic families-20240430112949412.webp]]
			Haloalkanes
				The haloalkanes belong to a homologous series comprising of an alkane with one or more hydrogen atoms replaced by a halogen atom
				Properties of haloalkanes
					Higher boiling points and melting points than corresponding alkanes as they are polar
					Increase with molecular size
					Haloalkanes are only slightly soluble in water but are more soluble in organic solvents. They are used as organic solvents because they can dissolve non-polar compounds and, apart from fluoroalkanes, they are more reactive than alkanes
		Alkenes
			Unsaturated hydrocarbons
			One or more double bonds
			Reactions of alkenes
				Combustion reactions
					Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because of the availability of extra electrons in the double bond to react. They undergo combustion reactions with oxygen and, like alkanes, form carbon dioxide and water.

				Addition reactions
					Addition reactions a reaction in which one molecule bonds covalently with another molecule without losing any other atoms; only one product is formed. Alkenes can undergo self-addition in which the alkene molecules join together to make long chains called polymers

	Physical properties of Hydrocarbons
		Hydrocarbons are non polar 
			do not dissolve in water
		Crude Oil is composed of hydrocarbons
		Used to make plastics, petrol, diesel, tarmac and gas.
		Increase in size leads to increase in boiling point

Naming Organic Compounds and isomers
	Naming Straight Chain Alkanes
		Alkane names always have a prefix, which tells us the number of carbons in the chain
		The suffix of a name tells you the homologous series, or category that the molecule belongs to
