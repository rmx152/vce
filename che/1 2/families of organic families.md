				Substitution reactions
					Reaction in which a group of atoms is removed and replaced by another atom
					One or more fluorine or chlorine atoms take the place of one or more hydrogen atoms
						This creates haloalkanes
					![[families of organic families-20240430112949412.webp]]
			Haloalkanes
				The haloalkanes belong to a homologous series comprising of an alkane with one or more hydrogen atoms replaced by a halogen atom
				Properties of haloalkanes
					Higher boiling points and melting points than corresponding alkanes as they are polar
					Increase with molecular size
					Haloalkanes are only slightly soluble in water but are more soluble in organic solvents. They are used as organic solvents because they can dissolve non-polar compounds and, apart from fluoroalkanes, they are more reactive than alkanes
		Alkenes
			Unsaturated hydrocarbons
			One or more double bonds
			Reactions of alkenes
				Combustion reactions
					Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because of the availability of extra electrons in the double bond to react. They undergo combustion reactions with oxygen and, like alkanes, form carbon dioxide and water.
					![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/34MlR3b4jEcr6IgobUjbNMHnqqn8kDxkcF3ZcR9NUqsxymoXIcin_qjcqv_PpYSho-DdT9zh3itKlO7PovnfY1SrmDE1LbXj2CsT2HyffB2qUiluf5PsWqHEDxEBOFhxTD8SeRfzdxYA05WujAwZde1lAw=s2048)
				Addition reactions
					Addition reactions a reaction in which one molecule bonds covalently with another molecule without losing any other atoms; only one product is formed. Alkenes can undergo self-addition in which the alkene molecules join together to make long chains called polymers

	Physical properties of Hydrocarbons
		Hydrocarbons are non polar 
			do not dissolve in water
		Crude Oil is composed of hydrocarbons
		Used to make plastics, petrol, diesel, tarmac and gas.
		Increase in size leads to increase in boiling point

	What is a Functional Group?
		A specific arrangement of atoms in a molecule that has special chemical and physical properties 
		Types of functional groups
			Hydroxy functional groups
				![[families of organic families-20240513092004439.webp|180]]
				Alcohols
				The alcohol homologous series contain a hydroxy functional group - an Oxygen covalently bonded to a Hydrogen. 
				All alcohols will end in the suffix ‘ol’
				When naming these molecules, we need to make sure that the carbon the hydroxy group is on is numbered in the name 
				![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iuz83nWLkk9__uN2wUs4YPzjobapF-DRtiTZleT84rbyxwa69-ZgMBu6fbHAzZBeUIxlG_CXoEOA7nXHV-JB1tQsl6eLzPm9Ae43j4qg9A5kZPtHKng8J3KwXF-i2VmNY_ieJpD7549b27p1yRnCb0E6mQ=s2048)
				Representing hydroxy groups
					In full structural formula, you must always show the bond between the O-H - if you do not, you will lose marks
					In semi structural formula, we do not wrap the OH group in brackets
					A common mistake when naming alcohols is students will forget the ‘an’ in the name. Eg Pent - 2 - ol. The ‘an’ helps signify that there are no C=C bonds in this alcohol - it is reminiscent of the name alkane
					![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_J1Z2UhKYcVawvT33CY83NCzwA2bCuwffiNWWQAGWUiWW57Eiw4Ys0_eOM_bIDzGlU-z1C8Y7Qg9mnvc1h_xlaERVC_qfpnS_BrPJ_rGZkYUCCZXnH-VYpP_UVJmJABbB1D-dK9E3bzymedJoYMoOh_8nQ=s2048)
					If an alcohol has a C=C bond
						When there are two functional groups in a molecule, you need to decide what the most important group is, with the highest priority - this helps you decide which end you start counting from
						Hydroxy groups have a higher priority than alkene C=C bonds, so we start counting from the end closest to the hydroxy
						The ‘an’ in the name turns into ‘en’ to signify an alkene is here too
						![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zZJXADgehlSQ2MWdI7BLqyrOaY6DHUh7AaktyjLxYtH0HQykI8wQBn8yTmMwgRHVMOayZ9oMguarNYSwi6WST7_WNxn62Q_cDLm-Tp8B5qglQVsaWU0OTngSYRzDOMFJ97NmSCUho-P2Ay1xN4wvxcy03g=s2048)
					Alcohols with branches
						Hydroxy groups also have a higher priority than alkyl branches, and so we start counting from the end closest to the hydroxy
						![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/38F0Gp4AlxoE3bHmkxHvxPjqi3jbFxS738IVK7QQiEeOUdBWUuQotS3Ga1qnf3ENmQ2Eh_6GIwYWohlwwU7BRGiZzisDr82H_Dq2ogsAQ_6ChXRlrMpoWN7PQIAQ_S2lpcvQCVJ6AiANDVACwoNkI-pKmA=s2048)
			Carboxy functional groups
				![[families of organic families-20240513092011523.webp|199]]
				Carboxylic acids
				The Carboxylic Acids are a homologous family with a carboxy functional group
				The carboxy functional group is actually a combination of two functional groups together - a hydroxy and a carbonyl functional group
				Carboxy functional groups have the highest priority of all functional groups
				Carboxy functional groups are always counted to be on Carbon 1, so you will not need to number where a carboxy group is in a hydrocarbon
				The end in the suffix ‘- oic acid’
				![[families of organic families-20240513092819132.webp|259]]
				Representing carboxylic acids
					make sure to show all bonds and atoms in full structural formula, including the O-H bond. 
					This is also recommended in skeletal structure
					In semistructural formula, it is common convention to see the Carboxy group (-COOH) at the end of the formula
					![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XRws1F2U6VfgYi8YnB7Byja8sefLe4c2L3fNFB1WM3_1jtTOSXgthz1jy09VGF12ylm2Uxjrb8CjfxorG0DqGY532MdvKrRQpc1K26IdLxaSEjb7pHSjl0x5meJGlS5jEO7Kxf1qEeAZdxGI5fzXPjI0rw=s2048)
				Carboxylic Acids with Branches
					As always, branches are names out the front of the name.
					Remember we start counting from the carbon in the carboxy group, always
					![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-EmoEwZSaNM1l3bmdO6I1xFm1tvUjAoSeKSPyxYJ9zMWRv8FjhzQvcuCWqTbMqTyE8o1b6NI8g34uxK7JVK8eI2jlPya3PrL6HdqkDKF80iUxpUX7nRDySdH2TZaznQaDILY2JokXyA3OOdFltDwnWswQQ=s2048)
				Carboxylic Acids with Hydroxy groups
					Carboxylic Acids are the highest priority functional group - so the molecule pictured to the left is a carboxylic acid with a hydroxy functional group, NOT an alcohol with a carboxy functional group
					Since the hydroxy group is not the highest priority, it is named out the front with the prefix ‘hydroxy’
					The suffix of the name is ‘oic acid’, since this molecule is a Carboxylic Acid
					![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/m5C9OtLHyMWYQjxyx5LVzFgQMjNYQSRw65LG5lM7apQazTRUL8Nlg_4Q6wi4ftw0v3DSriUuNcSgECt4HRwFIj76aoVtjCoOYXsJ66Efz4ERnp65zZ6Qw9wSeCYKM7GH8ydM-GSZOb-BWYS7aIQZTwZQGQ=s2048)
			Halo functional group
				![[families of organic families-20240513092019346.webp|182]]
				Haloalkane homologous family
				Haloalkanes are a family of hydrocarbons (a homologous series) that contain a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I)
				The functional group is known as a halo functional group
				Often ‘X’ is used to denote any of the halogens
				‘R’ just refers to any number of carbons in a hydrocarbon.
				![[families of organic families-20240513092138711.webp|296]]
				Branched haloalkanes
					If you have a halogen and a branch, you still follow the alphabetical order rule 
					any prefix’s out the front of a name must be counted and listed in alphabetical order
					![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GCHLFPkMic0ecPQl0yw0yx4y_dbbPWIyMQGx3ZoK3ezw2JTnP71iLaMyfriMO5XypFRfJLIwHN25YE1YM1p1wq4g7GHBIqlIVsSGnnMShS3t7CtXezA7__wlp135CofOS7Shtydrr5wa3fCs645bNag8iQ=s2048)

Esterification
	Esters are a homologous series, with an ester functional group, synthesised in a reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid
	Esterification is a condensation reaction
		Produce water as a byproduct
		![[families of organic families-20240514110652965.webp|444]]
	functional groups are specific arrangements of atoms that can participate in specific chemical reactions
	In an esterification reaction, the hydroxy group in any alcohol and the carboxy group in any carboxylic acid react together to form an ester.
	A catalyst is necessary though 
		Sulfuric Acid needs to be added before anything can happen
		![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MdZqmFJWdJG0f_yxLeC1si5pqhTF2nIFLuhRmxX69ZTUBY1ebgv3Pd37MtNRwSDbTZzXEHsrHlrgYbw7UJFH-tk2vPbeMJMseag_AfVlHrUDMKL7m5b6A9HEp1aITQvnzWAgmbeSHeVn6Btw-OwkapGQ_w=s2048)
	Naming esters
		Esters are named after the alcohol and carboxylic acid they are made from. 
		The alcohol is named first, as if it were a branch
			The Carboxylic Acid is named second, with the suffix -oate![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-zhwo0JOjOOIJW3_k4Zne4UCVh5KBxjbRlZgekHeHSwcgP17B2lOVezVXx968Xq4D1IrF74NObw0CG516feCqNQrC8STsWrXWNAP9SoOc7T0ivjTTePm4kb8jHSm-z8qrAZvdPD1STP5HWxx57amzoi-wQ=s2048)
