Relative Atomic Mass
	Atomic mass is the sum of protons and neutrons, since they are the subatomic particles with mass
Isotopes
	Different variations of the same element with a different number of neutrons and a different atomic mass
Avagadro’s Constant
	6.02 × 10^23 particles
	The mole is a type of unit that counts particles
	Avagadros's Constant is used to calculate the amount of particles in a specific sample

	Mass
		The Relative Atomic Mass of an element is the mass in grams of 1 mole of that substance
		The Molar Mass of a compound is how many grams 1 mole of that compound weighs
		Molar Mass is exactly the same as relative atomic, formula or molecular mass.
		It has the units g/mol, since it measures how many grams 1 mole weighs

		Example
			n(Cu) = m/M
				Input the variables
			n = 5g / 63.55 g/mol
				Calculate for the number of moles
			n(Cu) = 0.079 mol
