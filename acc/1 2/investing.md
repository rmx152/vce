Investing is the act of putting economic resources into something with the intention of making monetary gain. Individuals, wage and salary earners, small business owners, and companies all get involved in investing at one time or another. 
Investors may put their cash into a variety of schemes, with two basic objectives:
	To achieve a cash return : dividends
	To achieve a capital gain : selling stocks
The type of investment depends on the objectives of the investor and which the investor prefers. Dividends are usually offered by established businesses, whereas capital gain is directed towards companies that reinvest and grow the business at a fast rate. 
Types of investment opportunities
	Savings account
		At call : money can be deposited and withdrawn whenever the owner requests
		The advantages of savings accounts is that they are secure investments with little to no risk
		The disadvantage is that they tend to earn a low rate of interest, or no interest
	Term deposit
		An individual with cash to invest for an extended period of time may prefer a term deposit. The cash would be deposited for a specific period, such as a month, 3 months, 6 months, a year, where the investor will not be able to withdraw any money. This is incentivised with a higher interest rate than savings accounts.
		Online investment accounts
