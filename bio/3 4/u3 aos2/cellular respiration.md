Cellular Respiration
	Usable energy for cells
			Chemical energy, like glucose, cannot be used directly by cells
			Needs to be transferred to other compounds like ATP before it can be used by cells
			Cellular respiration breaks down glucose to more simple compounds ðŸ¡ª these reactions generate ATP
			Rate of respiration depends on energy needs and how fast energy is being used (metabolism)
		Heat production
			Glucose to ATP conversion is not 100% efficient
			Some chemical energy is converted to and â€˜lostâ€™ as heat energy
			About 40% of chemical energy in glucose is transferred to ATP
			Remaining 60% appears as heat energy ðŸ¡ª thatâ€™s why organisms with higher metabolisms feel warmer and why warm blooded endotherms need to eat more
		ATP
			Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) = Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) + inorganic phosphate (Pi)
			Energy is needed to form ATP molecules
			Energy is released when the bond connecting Pi and ADP is broken by an enzyme. Itâ€™s a catabolic and exergonic reaction
			One mole of glucose contains 2800 kJ whilst one ATP contains 30kJ. 
			ATP is easier to use
	Aerobic respiration
		Making ATP in the presence of oxygen ðŸ¡ª higher yield of energy
		Glucose (C6H12O6) is oxidised to form Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Water (H2O) ðŸ¡ª this is essentially a combustion reaction
		In human cells, this reaction takes place at 37Â°C in a series of steps that releases small amounts of energy, which is transferred to ATP
		Outside of the cell, glucose can be oxidised in a single step by heating it up to 200Â°C, with most energy released as heat
		Steps for aerobic respiration start in the cytosol (glycolysis) and mitochondria (Krebs cycle and electron transport chain)
		Mitochondria
			Comprised of two membranes
			Inner membrane is highly folded and called the cristae 
				Highly folded to increase surface area
			Gel-like matrix in the centre that contains lots of enzymes (like the stroma of a chloroplast)
			Number of mitochondria present differs depending on the energy usage of the cell 
			Mitochondria within the cell tend to be clustered in areas of high energy (like near the flagellum or where there is active transport)

		Steps
			Step 1 : Glycolysis
				â€˜Glycoâ€™ = glucose; â€˜Lysisâ€™ = break down
				Takes place in the cytosol of cells
				Made up of 10 reactions that are each controlled by a specific enzyme
				Initial reactant is a 6-carbon glucose and the final products are 2 3-carbon pyruvate molecules
				Process uses some ATP but produces a net yield of 2 ATP
				Glucose has hydrogen atoms removed ðŸ¡ª collected by 2 carrier or acceptor NAD+ molecules (like cheques that can be exchanged for money later on) as 2 NADH

			Step 2: Krebs cycle
				Also known as the Citric Acid Cycle
				Starts with the pyruvate formed from glycolysis
				Krebs cycle occurs in the inner compartment of the mitochondria (matrix)
				The 2 pyruvate molecules are converted into 2 acetyl CoA molecules as they enter the mitochondria. 2 CO2 are also formed from this conversion
				Each of the acetyl CoA molecules take turns to enter the Krebs cycle. Each turn produces 1 ATP and 2 CO2 ðŸ¡ª total of 2 ATP and 4 CO2 from 2 pyruvate
				As the cycle proceeds, hydrogen atoms are gathered by acceptor molecules NAD and FAD (flavine adenine dinuecleotide) ðŸ¡ª these are both coenzymes
				For each pyruvate, there is 4 NADH and 1 FADH2 formed
				![http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/biology/imgbio/tcae.gif|492](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/p1TJthNdsY9qaqcU6RrdP00G-YsCJQbZ0ZEcXc44O0eejoa6RZRObeZhue6aL46_xo-Al9pXU86AJFqmFvWg7lINzk38iJXYW70FyH9ezW-Yp1nGAGk-Is0uYJzHjOMl3w5RiZo4gK_qxF24DXE0LQ=s2048)
			Step 3: Electron Transport Chain
				The electron transport chain is where the bulk of ATP is synthesised
				Involves reactions of the â€˜loadedâ€™ acceptor molecules (NADH and FADH2)
				Electron transport involves proteins embedded in the folded inner membrane (cytochromes) 
					they transfer electrons along a chain of proteins whilst pumping protons (H+) into the space between the mitochondriaâ€™s membrane
				At the end of this chain of proteins, oxygen will act as a final acceptor to join together with the hydrogen to become H2O
				The hydrogen ions move through the enzyme ATP synthase as H+ move from an area of high concentration (between the membranes) to an area of low concentration (in the matrix)
				This movement powers ATP synthase to act like a spinning generator to build ATP 
					 this process is known as oxidative phosphorylation

		Respiration without oxygen ðŸ¡ª occurs in the cell cytosol after glycolysis
		Uses molecules other than oxygen as the final electron carrier from the electron transport chain
		Not as efficient as aerobic respiration ðŸ¡ª less ATP produced per glucose (2 ATP compared to 30 or 32 ATP) and by-products that can be harmful
		Two main forms in eukaryotes:
			Lactic acid fermentation
				Produces lactic acid from pyruvate in animals ðŸ¡ª lactic acid build up lowers pH around cells and causes damage if concentrated
				Different from alcohol fermentation as CO2 is not produced. NADH acceptors donates H+ to pyruvate
				Lactic acid can be broken down for energy again by converting it back to pyruvate. This can then enter the Krebs Cycle when there is enough oxygen present
				Lactic acid fermentation can be summarised as
					Glucose ðŸ¡ª Lactic acid + 2 ATP
			Alcohol fermentation
				Seen in eukaryotic yeast cells and some bacteria
				Takes the 2 pyruvate and 2 NADH from glycolysis to produce CO2 and ethanol (an alcohol)
				Each pyruvate has a CO2 removed to form the intermediate product acetaldehyde
				Each NADH acceptor donates H+ to each of the acetaldehyde to form an ethanol
				So in total we can simplify all these processes to:
					Glucose ðŸ¡ª Carbon Dioxide + Ethanol + 2 ATP
	Anaerobic respiration and biofuel
		Ethanol from alcohol fermentation is the new future of fuel that is renewable and more sustainable than fossil fuels
		As we can derive ethanol from biomass (organic material such as plants, animal by-products and biological waste), this fuel is referred to as biofuel
		Biofuels are typically carbon neutral ðŸ¡ª this means that the carbon dioxide emitted by burning this fuel is largely offset by the carbon that was originally absorbed to make the biomass we create the biofuel from

		Making biofuel
			![[cellular respiration-20240325123906477.webp|705]]
			An alternative to plant biomass

		Biodiesel vs Bioethanol
			Both are types of biofuel (fuel derived from biomass, like plant matter or waste)
			Bioethanol is produced from starch crops, such as corn or wheat, and sugar crops, such as sugar cane and sugar beet, and is primarily a replacement for petrol. 
			Biodiesel
				Biodiesel is a diesel-substitute made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Diesel is currently used as a primary source of energy on many farms, fuelling tractors, other vehicles, pumps, machinery and remote electricity generators
					Enzymes used in making biodiesel will be lipases to break down the lipids in oils
					The main reaction for converting oil to biodiesel is called trans-esterification. The trans-esterification process reacts an alcohol (like methanol) with the triglyceride oils contained in vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled greases, forming fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerin.

			Bioethanol
				Once we make bioethanol, it can be combusted like other fuels as a source of energy
				Currently this bioethanol is blended with traditional fossil fuel to reduce some carbon emissions than just pure fossil fuel burning
				The most well known blend of bioethanol and fossil fuel is E10 petrol where there is a mix of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline
				Whilst biofuels can reduce carbon emissions and provide an alternative fuel source from our dwindling fossil fuel supply, there are some downsides:
					The cost and difficulty of making bioethanol is higher than fossil fuel
					The majority of vehicles are optimised for fossil fuels and not biofuels
					Large crops of potential food is being used to make fuel, which is a challenge with growing food demands of the world
	Factors affecting the rate of respiration
		Measuring the rate of cellular respiration
			Glucose + Oxygen ðŸ¡ª Carbon Dioxide + Water + 30 or 32 ATP
			Ways we can measure the rate of cellular respiration:
				Glucose left after the reaction
				Oxygen use
				Carbon dioxide output
				Temperature
				Water output
				Lactic acid or ethanol production if there is anaerobic respiration
		Temperature
			![[cellular respiration-20240417111222193.webp]]
			As cellular respiration is heavily dependent on enzymes, an increase in temperature past the optimal range can denature key enzymes in respiration.
			Low temperatures lowers the kinetic energy of substrates and enzymes, so lowers the number of collisions for reactions to occur
		pH
			![[cellular respiration-20240417111312638.webp]]
			pH also affects the enzymes of respiration, with a pH outside of the optimal range causing structural changes to the enzymeâ€™s active site and lowering the rate of reaction
		Enzyme inhibitors
			Molecules can bind to enzymes at an allosteric site to regulate the action of the enzyme ðŸ¡ª this is known as feedback inhibition
				Feedback inhibition prevents the cell from undergoing processes that it doesnâ€™t need and wasting energy (like the regulation of the Trp operon in bacteria)
				This mechanism prevents excess ATP from being made if the cell has enough made already
			Regulatory molecules made from respiration can inhibit the enzymes at different stages of cellular respiration
			For example, ATP can bind to the enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) that catalyses glycolysis of glucose
			When ATP (and other molecules like citrate) binds to an allosteric site of PFK, it can inhibit glycolysis, thus reducing the production of pyruvate
			This is especially useful when plenty of ATP has been made or to avoid the build up of pyruvate which will be converted into fermentation products in low oxygen
			There can also be regulators that bind and activates the action of an enzyme
			![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mUEmyg-hGiTh_hCI8dw9LRkxp7I6D_NHe189keYqzeWUjrTdh_1EZeYX0qCcRm0KnKawj4vQGxyl_1oOJIU5SRnRlzhtOPv1KLrrY42ZUO2vwt8sn9pKx_nYDUikKULDpkC_mp6FX0ap6kTcj-mN1Q=s2048)
		Glucose availability
			The more glucose available, the more cellular respiration can occur
			However, as cellular respiration is enzyme dependent, increasing glucose concentration will eventually reach a saturation point for respiration enzymes
			The enzymes are all occupied and will work at their maximum rate. This is seen as a plateau in the graph
			![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qNcdHhvJRPROTnsGNdT7zYBVdv-IuyxN6GTNhatdyXonivlLGRPZNZx413bdG-8NkMxX7AV5-fACxLqjPfLII2VtrgeMtZ4nF7Pecop83JhmOo2LrSgoXR1e1zUlh888rq4fKN_J87ksbAIGnMNL5g=s2048)
		Oxygen availability
			Whether oxygen is available determines whether aerobic or anaerobic respiration will occur
			In animals, anaerobic respiration is a faster method for getting ATP and will be used when oxygen needs are higher than what is available (for example â€“ when a sprinter is running)
			Long term, animals will need to switch to aerobic respiration however to increase efficiency of ATP production and to prevent the build up of lactic acid in cells (for example â€“ in a long distance runner)
			![useruploads.socratic.org](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PSJK2wjUoZSMFsH2CA0zC7ATDPFaSicgtfrfKqnhNr5pTgrBuPlFcGaJuNwSvsX8vpJ5QYlF9270M93CHZPvTtGdk_FUFaXh4yeuzv77LJLFfN0uoNu18plowADvt69lYPNg_g0oSDWKnEabM7GF7A=s2048)
		Oxygen is a reactant for aerobic respiration and will increase the rate of cellular respiration as concentrations increase
		As concentration increases however, the enzymes are a limiting factor and will all be saturated with substrate
		This causes a plateau to the graph for rate of reaction
