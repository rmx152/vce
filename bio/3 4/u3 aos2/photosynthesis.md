Chemical equation

How plants use light
	Plants are dependent on light to grow and survive 
		their movements work to maximize how much light they absorb
	Plants absorb light energy and convert it to chemical energy (glucose) through photosynthesis 
		 ‘photo’ = light; ‘synthesis’ = making something from smaller parts.
	Photosynthesis is broken into two reactions:
		The Light Dependent reaction
		The Light Independent reaction 
		![[light dep v indep.png]]
	Chloroplast
		The chloroplast - enclosed by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow space.
		Membranes also divide the interior of the chloroplast into compartments
			flattened sacs called thylakoids, which in places are stacked into structures called grana.
			the stroma (fluid) outside the thylakoids.
		Contain DNA and also ribosomes, which are used to synthesize some of the proteins in the chloroplast 
			 endosymbiosis theory of its origin (Chloroplasts were once prokaryotes)

	Grana
		Where light-dependent reactions take place
		![[grana.png]]
	Chlorophyll
		Chlorophyll absorbs light from the spectrum of light
			It doesn’t absorb green light, so this is reflected into our eyes and gives plants its green colour
		Chlorophyll is embedded in the thylakoid membrane to trap sunlight energy needed to split water molecules
		Chloroplasts contain several pigments that absorb different wavelengths of light
			Chlorophyll a
			Chlorophyll b 
			Xanthophyll 
			Carotene
			Phaeophytin

	Pigments - Absorption spectrum
		The absorption spectrum of different photosynthetic pigments provides clues to their role in photosynthesis, since light can only perform work if it is absorbed.

	Important parts of a leaf
		The mesophyll layer of plants (in particular palisade cells) is where the bulk of photosynthesis occurs
			These cells have a lot of chloroplast in them
		Water is transported in via the xylem and leaves the leaf as water vapour through transpiration
		Gases (CO2, O2, water vapour) move in and out of the leaf through stomata
		Guard cells control whether the stoma is open or closed

	Photosynthesis in C3 plants
		There are a number of different plants that undergo different pathways during the light independent reaction (Calvin cycle)
		During the Calvin cycle, plants undergo a process called carbon fixation. This is where they take CO2 gas and ‘fix’ it to become glucose molecules
		A C3 plant uses a particular pathway to do this called the C3 carbon fixation pathway
			In this pathway, CO2 is first fixed into a compound containing three carbon atoms before entering the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis.
		85% of plants are C3 plants
		Electron carriers
			NADPH, ATP (and FADH2 + NADH in cellular respiration) are coenzymes
			They are small molecules that cannot catalyse reactions 
				they can help enzymes do this though
			They themselves are not proteins but can bind to proteins to form active enzymes
			They become ‘charged’ once they bind to ions such as H+ (NADP+ and H form NADPH) or inorganic molecules like phosphate (ADP and Pi form ATP) 
				 act as electron carriers
		Light dependant stage
			Inputs:
				Water
				ADP + Pi
				NADP+
			Outputs:
				ATP (Used in Light Independent)
				Hydrogen (Carried to the Light Independent as NADPH)
				Oxygen (released as O2)
			Light and water go into the granum of the chloroplast
			One H+ is split from the water
			Oxygen leaves
			![[light depen.png]]
			The H+ then attaches to NADP+ to become NADPH
			The ADP and the Pi join together to become ATP
			![[light depen2.png]]
		Light independent phase
			Inputs:
				Carbon dioxide
				Hydrogen (on NADPH)
				ATP
			Outputs:
				ADP and Pi
				NADP+
				Glucose
			In the Calvin cycle CO2 enters.
			The H+ is taken form NADPH and ATP energy
			Glucose is made
			![[light in phase.png]]
			Takes place in the stroma
			The Calvin cycle does not require light 
				This does not mean it only occurs at night ; it does not need light for it to take place
			Relies on an enzyme called RuBisCO to fix carbon dioxide before it is converted into glucose

			RuBisCO (rubisco)
				Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase is the most abundant protein on Earth, making up 30-50% of the soluble protein in a leaf
				In the process of carbon fixation, rubisco acts as an enzyme that incorporates carbon dioxide into an organic molecule during the first stage of the Calvin cycle.
				The substrate of rubisco is carbon dioxide gas and Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP)
				When CO2 binds with the 5-carbon RuBP, it forms an unstable 6-carbon intermediate product that will be immediately broken down into two 3-carbon molecules
				These two 3-carbon molecules will go on to form glucose in a series of reactions
				![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/D-Q2yuqurNjBcboFaOiVaG66mu7bOIzMmRvdHc1Adt3gI9iTa6la3klP0PXQa9RFjwNfGOFNLYp5_XUIx7wyqtV6cSJZphr5hHIvN-us6fCSYhJ0sT78VK4pS2W2zCFFIT1KXG3x2RG5CUUHbNqW2Q=s2048)

			Conversion of Triose Phosphate
				Triose phosphate (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, G3P, GALP, PGAL), produced during photosynthesis, is the base product leading to the formation of many other molecules. It is converted to:
					Glucose, the fuel for cellular respiration; supplies energy for metabolism.
					Cellulose, a component of plant cell walls is formed using glucose as a building block.
					Starch granules act as a reserve supply of energy, to be converted back into glucose when required.
					Disaccharides. Glucose is converted to other sugars such as fructose, found in ripe fruit, and sucrose, found in sugar cane.
					Lipids and amino acids.

	C4 and CAM plants
		C3
			Plants that use the Calvin Cycle to directly fix CO2 to make glucose are called C3 plants
			C3 plants must live in areas where CO2 concentration is high, temperature and light intensity are moderate, and ground water is abundant.
			When stomata are open to let carbon dioxide in, they also let water vapor out, leaving C3 plants at a disadvantage in drought and high-temperature environments.
			In hot areas, the stomata are closed to prevent water loss. However, it results in the rise of O2 level. 
			When this occurs, rubisco reacts with O2 instead of CO2, and leads to photorespiration, which in turn, causes wasteful loss of CO2 in C3 plants.
		Photorespiration
			Rubisco can use either CO2 or O2 as a substrate
			Rubisco adds whichever molecule it binds to a five-carbon compound called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). 
			The reaction that uses CO2 is the first step of the Calvin cycle and leads to the production of glucose. 
			The reaction that uses O2 is the first step of the photorespiration pathway, which wastes energy and "undoes" the work of the Calvin cycle

			Conditions affecting rubisco and photorespiration
				Rubisco is an enzyme and is thus affected by many factors that affect other enzymes
				In particular, Rubisco is affected by substrate concentration and temperature
				In general, having a high concentration of CO2 present in plant cells is preferable as this gives Rubisco a high substrate concentration to act upon.
					However, keeping stomata open to let in lots of CO2 results in water vapor loss from the plant, which is not ideal in hotter climates. 
					Plants may choose to close their stomata to conserve water, resulting in a higher concentration of O2 trapped inside the leaf and left to react with rubisco
				Higher temperatures will cause more water loss from the plant if the stomata remain open, and higher temperatures also sees rubisco having a higher affinity for O2 compared to CO2 at more moderate temperatures
				Water availability in a plant influences whether guard cells are turgid (filled with water) which results in open stomata. When the plant loses water, water diffuses out of guard cells and it becomes flaccid, closing over the stomata and stopping further water vapour loss

			Plants that can handle photorespiration
				Not all plants live in moderate temperatures with lots of water available, so they have evolved adaptations to minimise the effects of photorespiration
				C4 or CAM plants will use additional energy to overcome photorespiration
				C4 plants are named after a 4-carbon molecule that they make during carbon fixation
					C4 plants live in hot sunny environments
						E.g. corn, sugarcane and switchgrass
				CAM plants are named after crassulacean acid metabolism. CAM plants are the first family of plants that this pathway was observed in
					CAM plants live in very hot, dry environments 
						E.g. cacti, pineapples and orchids
			![[c4vc3vcam.png]]
		C4 plants
			 In C4 plants, unique leaf anatomy allows carbon dioxide to concentrate in 'bundle sheath' cells around Rubisco. 
			Mesophyll cells pump carbon dioxide straight into bundle sheath cells with Rubisco, effectively removing Rubisco’s contact with oxygen and the need for photorespiration. 
			What's more, this adaptation allows plants to retain water through the ability to continue fixing carbon while stomata are closed.

			![[132.png]]
			Calvin cycle
				C4 plants avoid photorespiration by using another enzyme called PEP during the first step of carbon fixation. 
				This step takes place in the mesophyll cells that are located close to the stomata where carbon dioxide and oxygen enter the plant. 
				PEP is more attracted to carbon dioxide molecules and is, therefore, much less likely to react with oxygen molecules. 
				PEP fixes carbon dioxide into a four-carbon molecule, called malate, that is transported to the deeper bundle sheath cells that contain Rubisco. 
				The malate is then broken down, producing carbon dioxide that Rubisco fixes into sugars—without having to deal with the oxygen molecules that are abundant in the mesophyll cells.
				![[C4 plant calvinm.png]]
		CAM plants
			CAM plants are adapted to arid environments where water loss is high, and stomata must remain closed during the day
			CAM plants conduct most of their gas exchange in the cooler night-time air,
			CO2 is converted into a 4-carbon compound during the night, when stomata are open, and CO2 is able to diffuse into the leaf
			The 4-carbon molecule moves to mesophyll cells during the day and is converted into CO2. Rubisco can then use this CO2 for the Calvin cycle to make glucose

		Summary

Example
	In order for photosynthesis to occur, there must be sufficient movement of water into the chloroplast. Using your understanding of photosynthesis, explain how the chloroplast maintains a concentration gradient to continually bring water into the chloroplast (3 marks)
		1. There is a high concentration of water outside of the chloroplast and a low concentration in the grana
		2. In the grana, water is broken down which makes the concentration of water low
		3. In an attempt to reach equilibrium, more water will enter the grana and the concentration gradient is maintained
