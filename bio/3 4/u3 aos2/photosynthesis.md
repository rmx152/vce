Chemical equation

How plants use light
	Plants are dependent on light to grow and survive 
		their movements work to maximize how much light they absorb
	Plants absorb light energy and convert it to chemical energy (glucose) through photosynthesis 
		 ‘photo’ = light; ‘synthesis’ = making something from smaller parts.
	Photosynthesis is broken into two reactions:
		The Light Dependent reaction
		The Light Independent reaction

	Chloroplast
		The chloroplast - enclosed by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow space.
		Membranes also divide the interior of the chloroplast into compartments
			flattened sacs called thylakoids, which in places are stacked into structures called grana.
			the stroma (fluid) outside the thylakoids.
		Contain DNA and also ribosomes, which are used to synthesize some of the proteins in the chloroplast 
			 endosymbiosis theory of its origin (Chloroplasts were once prokaryotes)

	Chlorophyll
		Chlorophyll absorbs light from the spectrum of light
			It doesn’t absorb green light, so this is reflected into our eyes and gives plants its green colour
		Chlorophyll is embedded in the thylakoid membrane to trap sunlight energy needed to split water molecules
		Chloroplasts contain several pigments that absorb different wavelengths of light
			Chlorophyll a
			Chlorophyll b 
			Xanthophyll 
			Carotene
			Phaeophytin

	Pigments - Absorption spectrum
		The absorption spectrum of different photosynthetic pigments provides clues to their role in photosynthesis, since light can only perform work if it is absorbed.

	Important parts of a leaf
		The mesophyll layer of plants (in particular palisade cells) is where the bulk of photosynthesis occurs
			These cells have a lot of chloroplast in them
		Water is transported in via the xylem and leaves the leaf as water vapour through transpiration
		Gases (CO2, O2, water vapour) move in and out of the leaf through stomata
		Guard cells control whether the stoma is open or closed

	Photosynthesis in C3 plants
		There are a number of different plants that undergo different pathways during the light independent reaction (Calvin cycle)
		During the Calvin cycle, plants undergo a process called carbon fixation. This is where they take CO2 gas and ‘fix’ it to become glucose molecules
		A C3 plant uses a particular pathway to do this called the C3 carbon fixation pathway
			In this pathway, CO2 is first fixed into a compound containing three carbon atoms before entering the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis.
		85% of plants are C3 plants
		Electron carriers
			NADPH, ATP (and FADH2 + NADH in cellular respiration) are coenzymes
			They are small molecules that cannot catalyse reactions 
				they can help enzymes do this though
			They themselves are not proteins but can bind to proteins to form active enzymes
			They become ‘charged’ once they bind to ions such as H+ (NADP+ and H form NADPH) or inorganic molecules like phosphate (ADP and Pi form ATP) 
				 act as electron carriers
