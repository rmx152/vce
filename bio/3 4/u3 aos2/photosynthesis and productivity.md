Factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis 
	Like with any chemical reaction, if we increase the concentration of the reactants then the yield of products from a reaction will increase
	Photosynthesis relies on carbon dioxide levels and water levels as the reactants for this process
	Light and chlorophyll, whilst not chemical inputs, will affect the rate of photosynthesis as these increase the rate of the reaction
	As photosynthesis is mediated by lots of enzymes (such as Rubisco), temperature will also play a role in the rate of photosynthesis

	Carbon dioxide concentration
		One of the reactants for photosynthesis is CO2. As a result, as you increase CO2 levels, you increase the rate of photosynthesis
		Carbon fixation in the light independent reaction is reliant on Rubisco in order for photosynthesis to progress
		Fixed amounts of Rubisco will limit the rate of photosynthesis even if CO2 levels are increasing
		The rate of photosynthesis is also limited by the amount of products from the light dependent reaction
		A plateau can be seen when we graph this – note that when the graph plateaus, there is a steady rate of photosynthesis, not zero photosynthesis!

		C3 vs C4 plants
			C3 plants are reliant on high atmospheric CO2 levels in order to fix carbon using Rubisco and to avoid photorespiration
			Increased concentration of CO2 means that the likelihood of collisions between CO2 and Rubisco is more likely than Rubisco and O2
			C4 plants aren’t as reliant on high atmospheric CO2 and can photosynthesise at a high rate if there is already some stored malate (the 4-Carbon molecule made by PEP) to later convert to intracellular CO2 for use in the Calvin Cycle

	Water availability
		Water availability has a huge effect on C3 plants that rely on larger quantities of water to photosynthesise whilst keeping their stomata open to allow CO2 in
		If water availability is low, C3 plants must close their stomata to prevent the water loss that happens through transpiration
		This puts C3 plants at risks of photorespiration as O2 builds up inside the leaf when stomata are closed
		C4 and CAM plants are able to overcome low water availability through various mechanisms but will ultimately still need some water to photosynthesise

	Light
		Wavelength
			The wavelength of light (colour) and the intensity of light can affect the rate of photosynthesis
			Plants that are predominantly green cannot photosynthesise effectively under green light as this wavelength is reflected by the chlorophyll
			Colours close to green, like yellow, can be absorbed but not as much a colours at the other ends of the light spectrum (blue and reds)
			![[wave legnth.png]]
		Intensity
			Light energy powers the light dependent reaction and photolysis of water
			Without it, there is no charged NADPH or ATP to be used in the light independent reaction
			Photosynthesis is limited by enzyme concentration and reactants so the graph will plateau
			Plants are undergoing cellular respiration 24/7 to break down glucose into water and carbon dioxide. In the dark, only respiration can occur and no photosynthesis can happen

	Temperature
		High temperatures will decrease the rate of photosynthesis in C3 plants, but will not have as big of an effect on C4 and CAM plants that are adapted to live in hot environments
		As with all enzyme reliant reactions, photosynthesis has a lower rate of reaction at low temperatures due to less kinetic energy of substrates and enzymes, and fewer collisions
		High temperatures will see an increase in collisions (and rate of photosynthesis) however a temperature above optimal temperatures may denature key proteins for photosynthesis like Rubisco and those in chlorophyll			![Best Transpiration GIFs | Gfycat](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ZHIojLVZBEKV7Oa4ToOjNKipbeMZsIwwg1W5TNulonvsLjzwtscaT219LqK4gXkX7mWwl93X0iFr5SEJBy1yyyGSGSKy-m32nQ-Md4zXPDa34GFBfG2WzgjRxclAFCM2GnJuir_IlBelGX-y5P3pxw=s2048)
			Increased temperature increases the transpiration of water up the xylem and out of the stomata as water vapour. Keeping stomata open increases water loss in high temperatures'

	Enzyme inhibitors
		Both competitive and non-competitive inhibitors exist that prevent photosynthesis enzymes, like Rubisco, from binding to their substrate (CO2 or RuBP)
		Inhibitors can be reversible or irreversible depending on how strongly they bind to the enzyme and what changes they make to the active site
		Competitive inhibitors can be reversed most of the time by increasing the substrate concentration as this knocks the inhibitor off the active site of the enzyme		
			Note that inhibitors don’t stop the rate of a chemical reaction completely. The reaction can still occur just at a much slower rate
		Some herbicides (plant killing chemicals) are inhibitors of photosynthetic enzymes, which leaves the plant unable to make its own food for survival
Design an experiment
	IV (including experimental groups), DV, CVs
	IV : Light intensity (lumens)
	DV : pH
	CV : time (1 hour), temperature, water levels, type of plant, wavelength of light, 
	A description of your experiment (instructions that someone can follow)
	Expected results and what this would tell you about your chosen IV and the effect on photosynthesis
	Don’t forget to consider the repeatability and reproducibility of your experiment
