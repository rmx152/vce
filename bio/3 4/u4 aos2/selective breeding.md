Selective breeding
	Human selection of phenotypes (physical traits) in plants and animals
	Development of particular traits that are wanted by humans → such as chickens that produce large eggs or wheat plants that produce lots of grain
	By breeding members of a species with a desired trait, the trait’s frequency becomes more common in successive generations
	Both selective breeding and natural selection can cause changes in animals (agriculture) and plants (horticulture)

	Seedless fruits
		Seedless grapes are the result of cultivation of naturally occurring seedless plants
		A genetic mutation causes the seeds to stop development 
		Though the flower is pollinated and the ovum fertilized, the seeds stop growing after a few weeks 
		Watermelons are usually diploid with 2 sets of chromosomes
		They are crossed with an abnormal tetraploid with 4 sets of chromosomes
		The offspring have 3 sets of chromosomes and produce almost no seeds
	Selective breeding process
		Selective breeding takes place over many generations. These are the main steps involved:
			1. Decide which characteristics are important enough to select
			2. Choose parents that show these characteristics
			3. Choose the best offspring from parents to produce the next generation
			4. Repeat the process continuously
		With each successive generation, the incidence of the allele coding for the desired trait increases in the population
	Dogs
		Dog breeds show an enormous amount of variety due to the targeted selection of particular traits by man
			Hunting dogs (e.g. beagles) were typically bred to be smaller in stature so as to enter fox holes
			Herding dogs (e.g. sheep dogs) were bred for heightened intelligence in order to follow herding commands
			Racing dogs (e.g. greyhounds) were specifically bred to be sleek and fast 
			Toy dogs (e.g. chihuahuas) were selectively bred for their diminutive size
		In terms of evolution, there has been a rapid change in gene pools in an extremely short period of time
		Whilst there is a large variety of alleles in the overall dog gene pool, most pure-breds have an incredibly small variety of alleles in their gene pool so that traits distinctive to a breed can develop
		As a result, there is a huge problem with genetically inherited issues in these dogs
	Selective breeding and speciation
		Selective breeding might either accelerate or prevent speciation processes in domesticated species
		In some cases, selective breeding blocks the gene flow between population as humans are restricting those in the population that can reproduce
		This can accelerate speciation if there are significant enough changes to the gene pool that are isolated to this population
		On the other hand, selective breeding can also prevent speciation that would likely occur by forcing gene flow to occur between groups that would typically not be able to mate together naturally (imagine a Chihuahua and a Great Dane out in the wild. They are unlikely to be able to mate)
