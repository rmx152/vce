The gene pool
	The total number of alleles in a particular population or a species is called its gene pool
	Each organism contributes two alleles to the gene pool 
		 two of the same alleles if they are homozygous, or two different alleles if they are heterozygous
	The frequency of the alleles in a gene pool can change as certain alleles can provide organisms with an adaptive advantage → those that survive contribute to the gene pool. Those who do not can be selected out of the gene pool
	Allele frequency
		Calculating allele frequency

		Influences on allele frequency
			 Factors that can influence the allele frequencies in a gene pool:
				Mutation of an allele
					Mutations cause variation in alleles
					Mutations accumulate over time causing descendants to be genetically distinct form their ancestors
					DNA replication can have mistakes that are not corrected
						This is a mutation
					Mutations can occur spontaneously 
					Mutation can be caused by a mutagenic agent (mutagen)
						Radiation and certain chemical compounds
						Induced mutation
					Results in variations in DNA causing certain traits to form
					Heritability of mutations
						Not all mutations are heritable
						Somatic mutations occur in non-reproductive cells and won't be passed onto offspring
						Germline mutations occur in reproductive cells and can be passed onto offspring
							Germline mutations will influence the evolution of a gene pool

					Point mutations
						DNA codes for amino acids
							Creates proteins
						Substitution mutation
							A substitution is a mutation that exchanges one base for another (i.e., a change in a single nucleotide such as switching an A to a G)
								Missense mutation
									Change a codon to one that encodes a different amino acid
									Causes a small change in the protein produced
								Silent mutation
									Change a codon to one that encodes the same amino acid 
									Causes no change in the protein produced
									Called neutral point mutations 
								Nonsense mutation
									 Changes an amino-acid-coding codon to a single "stop" codon and causes an incomplete protein to form
									 This can have serious effects since the incomplete protein probably won't function

						Insertion
							Insertions are mutations in which extra base pairs are inserted into a new place in the DNA
							Major effect on the amino acid sequence as codons are read in groups of three bases
							Every codon after the insertion is changed 
								called a frameshift mutation

						Deletion
							A deletion changes the number of DNA bases by removing a piece of DNA 
							Small deletions may remove one or a few base pairs within a gene, while larger deletions can remove an entire gene or several neighbouring genes 
							The deleted DNA may alter the function of the resulting protein 
								frameshift downstream of the mutation

						Chromosome
							Part of a chromosome can be deleted or simply rearranged 
							Duplicate chromosomes may fail to separate during cell division (non-disjunction) and this could cause genetic disorders
							Chromosomal deletions
								Results from the breakage of a chromosome in which the genetic material becomes lost during cell division
								Genetic material can break off from anywhere on the chromosome
								Missing DNA sequences can lead to major issues in protein synthesis
							Translocation 
								The joining of a fragmented chromosome to a non-homologous chromosome is a translocation. The piece of chromosome detaches from one chromosome and moves to a new position on another chromosome 
									frameshift mutation and can cause genes to be segmented and incomplete

							Inversion
								A broken chromosome segment is reversed and inserted back into the chromosome. Changes the order of genes and how the DNA sequence is read
								![[gene pools and mutations-20240612114656689.webp]]
							Duplications
								Duplications are produced when extra copies of genes are generated on a chromosome
								Duplicated segments of the chromosome, not the entire strand

							Aneuploidy and polyploidy
								Aneuploidy
									A chromosome mutation that causes individuals to have an abnormal number of chromosomes is termed aneuploidy 
									Aneuploid cells occur as a result of chromosome breakage or nondisjunction errors that happen during meiosis or mitosis
									It produces individuals with either extra or missing chromosomes
								Polyploidy
									A chromosome mutation that results in individuals with more than one haploid set of chromosomes in a cell is termed polyploidy
									Autosomal cells are diploid and contain 2 complete sets of 23 chromosomes → If a mutation causes a cell to have three haploid sets, it is called triploidy. If the cell has four haploid sets, it is called tetraploidy
