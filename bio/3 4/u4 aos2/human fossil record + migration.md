The human family tree
	There are currently 10-16 species that are recognised within the genus Homo
	Some of the members of this range of species are considered subspecies or not distinct enough to warrant recognition as separate species
		A species is a group of living things that can breed with each other to produce viable and fertile offspring. 			
		We can divide some (but not all) species into smaller groups called subspecies. These groups can still breed (and may sometimes produce hybrids), but they have physical and genetic differences. 
	The number and evolutionary relationships of species change as new evidence from fossils and DNA are uncovered

		Homo floresiensis
		Homo naledi
		Homo luzonesis

	Fossils vs DNA
		By looking at bones, prints and stones, this can help us to reconstruct how our ancestors behaved, what they ate and how they might have lived
		Data from the fossil record has given us information on diet, posture and movement, brain size, tool use and cultural evolution
		Looking at skull fragments, we can reconstruct facial features to a relatively high degree of accuracy if there are enough fossilised bone information
		DNA analysis give us information on how genetically related different species are
	Origins of modern humans
		Paleoanthropologists conclude that H. sapiens first evolved in Africa and that much of human evolution occurred on that continent
			What evidence supports this view?
				A lot of fossils
				Oldest fossils 
		Advances in DNA evidence and fossil analysis has enabled numerous hypotheses about the origins of humans to be tested directly
		Our interpretation of human evolutionary history is being revised as new data emerges
		![[human fossil record + migration-20240731105957682.webp|526]]
		Many models for human migration exist
		Some suggest that there may have been a single wave of migration out of Africa before early humans migrated across to Europe and Asia
		Others suggest that there may have been multiple waves of migration
		There may have even been recurrent episodes of migration back to Africa, making the fossil record difficult to interpret

		Homo genus migration
			The Out of Africa theory is the most widely accepted model: modern humans evolved from a discrete African population that outcompeted other Homo species
			These other members of the Homo genus came from Homo ergaster (working human), the first hominin to leave Africa around 1.9 mya and expanded into southern Eurasia about 1 mya
			Their descendants, Homo erectus (upright human), spread eastwards and established themselves in South East Asia (would go on to become H. neanderthalensis)
			After this first wave, there were gradual and continual waves of migration across Asia and western Europe (100,000 years ago)
		What made it possible to leave Africa?
			Homo ergaster was the first of our ancestors to possess the physical and cultural attributes needed in order to disperse though the arid environments of northern Africa and the Middle East. These attributes included:
				a modern body shape with an efficient striding gait suited to travelling over long distances
				a sufficiently developed intelligence to cope with unfamiliar environments
				improved technology to support themselves
				a diet that included more meat and which increased the food supply options in seasonally arid environments
		Hominin heritage in DNA
			When our early Homo sapiens ancestors first migrated out of Africa, they were not alone. At that time, at least two other species of hominin cousins walked the Eurasian landmassâ€”Neanderthals and Denisovans
			As our modern human ancestors migrated through Eurasia, they encountered the Neanderthals and interbred
			Everyone living outside of Africa today has a small amount of Neanderthal in them, carried as a living relic of these ancient encounters 
			A team of scientists comparing the full genomes of the two species concluded that most Europeans and Asians have between 1 to 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. Indigenous sub-Saharan Africans have no Neanderthal DNA because their ancestors did not migrate through Eurasia.

			Cross breeding with archaic species like Neanderthals can be tracked by looking at genetic signatures found in genomes today
			1.5-2% of the genome of non-africans was inherited from Neanderthals
			East Asians have significantly more Neanderthal genes than Europeans
				Suggests these ancestors interbred more than once
			These genetic markers are found mostly in autosome DNA, with none found the Y chromosome
				Suggests that hybrid males were strongly selected against
			Neanderthal genes seems to infer a greater risk for a range of diseases such as lupus, biliary cirrhosis, Crohnâ€™s disease, altered optic-disc size, smoking behaviour, Interlukin-18 levels (producing inflammation) and type 2 diabetes.
		Tracking human migration
			Mitochondrial DNA is used
			Traces inheritance through the maternal line
			Tracking the variants of mtDNA has shown sequence similarities in those with ancestors from the same area ðŸ¡ª supports the Out of Africa theory as changes in mtDNA can be traced back to these waves of migration
			Looking back, we can trace mtDNA to a group of H. sapiens that left the cradle of Africa
		Denisovans
			shared their genes with the ancestors of some Southeast Asians, New Guineans and Aboriginal Australians (about 3-5%)
			These living people also show the genetic signs of interbreeding with Neanderthals, so have inherited DNA from both of these species.
			In some cases Denisovan genes have given us a real benefit:
				Populations living today in Tibet to thrive at high altitude is the result of a gene inherited from the mysterious â€˜Denisovans.â€™
				The gene in question â€“ EPAS1 â€“ is associated with differences in haemoglobin levels at high altitude underpinning the capacity of the individuals carrying it to pump more oxygen around in their blood.
				The Denisovans also seem to have contributed genes that bolstered the immune systems of people in New Guinea and Australia.
			Denisovan and Neanderthal interbreeding
				In 2012, small bone fragments were found in Denisova Cave ðŸ¡ª the DNA was finally sequenced in 2018 and revealed the first confirmed evidence of Denisovan and Neanderthal interbreeding
				The DNA of these bone fragments revealed that the hominin was a teenage girl with a Neanderthal father and Denisovan mother
				Genome analysis also showed that the Denisovan father had at least one Neanderthal ancestor in his family tree, showing that these interbreeding events were not just a â€˜one-offâ€™
Migration to Australia
	DNA evidence also suggests that modern hominins reached the Australian continent approximately 55,000 years ago from South-East Asia (although the dating of cultural artefacts may place this arrival at 120,000 years ago)
	For humans to have arrived in Australia, we must consider how the geographical landscape used to look before Australia became an isolated island away from Asia
	At the time of the first migration events, Australia was part of a larger continent known as Sahul ðŸ¡ª this included Australia and New Guinea
		Whilst there were some land bridges between South East Asia and Sahul at times with low sea levels, there was still vast stretches of ocean to navigate. Migration to Sahul is evidence of one of the earliest seafaring journeys
	Migration routes
		Mathematical modelling suggests that First Nations people planned their journey and first arrived on Sahul in either a large single wave of at least 1000 people, or through multiple smaller waves of around 100 people over 700 years
		Whole genome analyses of Indigenous peoples from Australia and New Guinea show evidence that their ancestors left Africa approximately 70,000 â€“ 75,000 years ago, reaching Sahul around 50,000 years ago
		Mitochondrial DNA analyses shows that it is likely that ancestors of Indigenous Australians first arrived at what is now the north coast of Australia and then smaller groups migrated down the western and eastern coasts to establish their own unique Nations

	Connection to Country and Place
		Connection to Country and Place is the reciprocal relationship between First Nations people with their ancestral lands and seas, stories and creation spirits
		There is a belief that First Nations people are caregivers of the land, rather than the owners, and that all living things and land on Country and Place have value and should be respected
		Knowledge of Country and Place is passed on from generation to generation through oral histories and cultural traditions like song, art and dance.
		Indigenous Australian people are the longest surviving population of modern humans to have lived in a given location, and are thought to have one of the strongest Connection to Country and Place of any living population on earth
		Cultural and scientific evidence
			Songlines are travel routes used by Indigenous Australian to describe the environment and teach stories of cultural significance,
			These will often follow a Creation Story and can span across Australia
			Following a Songline and learning the stories associated with it could tell an Indigenous Australian about the lore of the land and important cultural teachings
			From a Western scientific perspective, it is believed that the Songlines follow the lines of human migration. The fossil and genetic evidence of migration matches the Songlines and traditional stories told by Indigenous Australians
		Rapid migration across Australia
			The extinction of the Australian megafauna approximately 42,000 years ago is also evidence for the rapid migration of modern hominins across Australia as First Nations people hunted these species down
			Evidence from DNA and cultural artefacts varies as to the amount of migration and gene flow between specific populations 
			However, there is evidence for prolonged connection over time of specific populations in specific areas of the Australian continent, in agreement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoplesâ€™ cultural beliefs and their central cultural attachment to Country and Place
Example
	Why might we classify some members of the homo genus in the fossil record as subspecies rather than species?
		The distinction of species may be difficult if the fossil record is incomplete and there is not enough molecular evidence to definitively work out that two populations have speciated
		We cannot test if the populations are capable of interbreeding successfully so definitive classifications may be difficult with the limited evidence available
		Furthermore, if the limited evidence we are testing are hybrids of two species then we might classify two populations as more related to each other than what they actually are.
