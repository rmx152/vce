Hominin evolution
	Humans did not evolve from apes such as gorillas and chimps. Instead, humans and apes share a common ancestor that lived millions of years ago 
	This common hominoid (ape) ancestor diverged over time to form many different species of hominid and then diverged even further to form hominins. 
	All the rest of the hominins, including early humans, became extinct. Modern humans are the only survivors of the hominins
	Mammals to hominins
		Mammals
			Animals with a variety of teeth (molars, canines, incisors), a single lower jawbone, mammary glands for milk, fur/hair over their bodies, and 3 middle bone ears for hearing
			Primates
				Mammals that have binocular vision, flat nails, prehensile hands, sensitive touch pads, and a large brain compared to body
				Hominoids (Apes)
					Primates with no tails (can be split into Great apes and lesser apes), Y5 molars, shorter spines, and a broader ribcage and pelvis
					Hominin
						The group consisting of modern humans, extinct human species and all our immediate bipedal ancestors (including members of the genera Homo, Australopithecus, Paranthropus and Ardipithecus).

		How to identify a primate
			Hands and feet
				Prehensile hands and feet
				Most have five digits on the appendages, including opposable thumbs
				With hands and feet, many primates are able to preform different types of grips, such as holding food or grabbing onto branches pr trunks
			Shoulders and hips
				primates have particularly flexible and limber shoulders and hip joints ðŸ¡ª These characteristics evolved to aid in the primates' primarily arboreal (tree dwelling) lifestyle
			Brain 
				Larger brain sizes
			Stereoscopic vision
				overlapping fields of vision (binocular)
			Nails
				having a nail on the first digit although, in many cases, each digit has a nail instead of a claw 
			Tendency to have erect posture
				this trait is visible when even quadrupedal primates sit or stand. Most species also occasionally exhibit bipedalism, or standing on the two hind legs like humans
		Hominoid features
			Some primates have features that make them hominoids (apes)
			Apes are the largest primates
			They have no tails
			They have a large brain size to body ratio
			They have a broader rib cage and pelvis to help with an upright posture when sitting
			They have long fingers
			Distinctive Y5 molar shape
			IN A QUESTION MUST USE FEATURES DISTINCTIVE TO HOMINOIDS
		Hominins
			Modern humans and their extinct erect-walking ancestors are termed hominins
			Humans are the only living members of the hominin group
			Hominins have features that aid in bipedalism (ability to walk on two legs)
			Hominins include members of the genera Homo, Australopithecus, Paranthropus and Ardipithecus

	Hominin evolution
		When did humans diverge?
			Information can be inferred by looking at the fossil record and estimated using the molecular clock principle
			The molecular clock principle assumes that changes in a given protein occur at a constant rate over time ðŸ¡ª the greater the differences between the same protein from different species, the longer the period since divergence
			Analysing ape vs human DNA, itâ€™s estimated that we diverged about 5-7 mya from chimpanzees
		Changes to become human
			Over time, gradual changes occurred from our ancestors:
				The brains of non-human hominins enlarged
				Hominin faces shortened and flattened
				Jaws and teeth became smaller ðŸ¡ª reflects changes in diet
				Ability to fashion tools developed
			Finally, hominins reached a stage where they were identifiably human as classified as members of the genus Homo
		Where did it begin?
			Until the late 19th century, no hominin fossils existed that might provide evidence of human evolution
			Since then, fossils have been found that show gradual changes in hominin structural development
			Oldest hominin fossils have all been found in Africa that supports the theory that hominins first appeared in Africa about 7 mya and then migrated 
			Split into a distinct group with bipedal (two-footed) movement at this time
		Bidpedalism
			Australopithecus africanus
				First hominin fossil found ðŸ¡ª supported the idea of early hominin bipedalism
				Found in 1924 in Taung, South Africa by local quarrymen, the fossil of this skull remarkably had a petrified replica of the brain inside
				The fossil was taken to Professor Raymond Dart, an Australian neuroscientist in Johannesburg, for study
				Dart found out that the skull belonged to a three year old hominin, judging by dental evidence
				About 2.8 million years old
				First time researchers saw evidence of early human upright, two-legged bipedal walking ðŸ¡ª The evidence was the position of the Taung Childâ€™s foramen magnum, or the hole through which the spinal cord connects with the brain 
				This spinal cord hole is positioned toward the front of the Taung Childâ€™s skull, a characteristic associated with bipedal locomotion ðŸ¡ª a four-legged ape has its foramen magnum positioned toward the rear of the head to keep its eyes facing forward (and not down) when it moves.
				Named the species Australopithecus africanus
			Australopithecus 
				Direct human ancestor in the hominini family ðŸ¡ª extinct genus
				About 4.4 millions years ago, a different type of primate emerged 
				The first bipedal primates are classified by paleontologists as hominids, and these first hominids had not yet developed the large brain, teeth structure, and skeletal features identified as Homo 
				Instead, they predate, and sometimes overlap the first Homo species and are known as the Australopithecines ðŸ¡ª as they are the immediate ancestors of modern humans, they are considered hominins
				Evidence for bipedalism
					Discovered in 1974 in the Afar region of Ethiopia by Donald Johanson and Maurice Taieb
					Dating of the fossil revealed that it was around 3.2 million years old, making it an earlier hominin than the Taung Child ðŸ¡ª oldest fossil of a mainly bipedal hominin
					40% of the fossil skeleton found
					Skeleton shows a powerful chest and strong upper arm muscles judging by long arm bones and marks of a large area for muscle attachment to bone
					She had a short, broad pelvis with thigh bones angled for upright walking
					Feet bones showed that Lucy could balance well on her feet and climb trees efficiently
					New paper published August 29th 2016 ðŸ¡ª the mystery of Lucyâ€™s death has finally been solved
					Lucy was most likely both terrestrial and arboreal (lived on the ground and in trees) ðŸ¡ª judging by her size she probably foraged in trees and slept there for protection
					Judging by fractures in her bones, it is thought that Lucy fell from a tree, causing death quite soon afterwards as there is no evidence of wound healing
					She would have been about 25-30 years old at her death looking at her teeth condition

			![[human change over time-20240724112908188.webp]]
		Arboreal and bipedal
			Australopithecus all walked upright regularly but also still climbed trees ðŸ¡ª seen in hip and feet bones
			Australopithecus afarensis (Lucy) was older than Australopithecus africanus (Taung Child)
			The jaw of Australopithecus members are transitional from chimpanzees ðŸ¡ª they are not as large and have smaller teeth
			A chimp has a box-like shaped jaw (left), whilst a human has a parabolic jaw (right). In comparison the Australopithecus afarensis jaw is rounded (middle)
			![[human change over time-20240724113244098.webp]]
		Transition from quadrupedal to bipedal
			Ardipithecus: Oldest human ancestors and the closest link to primates
			Evolved in Africa and took the first steps towards walking upright ðŸ¡ª switched rapidly from quadrupedal to bipedal movement as needed
			Pelvis shows that the alignment of the thigh and hip supported walking upright
			Big toes were closer related to chimpanzees as they are opposable to aid tree climbing and walking on fours
			Foramen magnum is closer to the back of the skull like in chimpanzees
		An evolutionary dead end
			The genus Homo would have developed from our non-human hominins the Australopithecus and the Ardipithecus before that
			The Australopithecus line looks like it split to give rise to the genus Homo (humans) and second group known as Paranthropus
			Members of the genus Paranthropus were robust, with large teeth and powerful jaws
			Itâ€™s not known why they died out but it is speculated that the Homo genus out-competed them or they were too specialised in their diet to adapt to changes in Africa about 1.2 million years ago
		Homo genus
			Homo, genus of the family Hominidae (order Primates) are characterized by: 
				A relatively large cranial capacity
				Limb structure adapted to a habitual erect posture and a bipedal gait
				Well-developed and fully opposable thumbs
				Hands capable of power and precision grips
				The ability to make standardized precision tools, using one tool to make another.
			The ability to create and construct sophisticated tools was thought to have been limited to members of Homo exclusively, with H. habilis (also known as the Handy Human) being the first to develop the stone-hewn pebble chopper some 2.6 million years ago.
			Cognitive development
				The Homo genus was the first to use fire in a controlled way ðŸ¡ª larger brain sized allowed for the cognitive development of the genus members
				May have been first used by Homo erectus ðŸ¡ª cave deposits in China have been dated to about 400,000 years old
				Further increase in brain size due to changes in diet ðŸ¡ª cooking food increased nutrients immensely and gave the brain energy for development. 20% of energy needs in a modern human is used by the brain

			Cultural evolution
				The evidence of fire use shows a massive turning point in human evolution
				The specialisation of skills in members of the Homo sapiens species increased the overall survival of the population ðŸ¡ª evidence of community behaviours and social connection seen in burial rituals, tool development and agriculture
				There is evidence of increasingly complex tools being developed as the brain and language skills developed
				Systematic hunting is also seen with structures found that would have been used to hunt larger animals
		Evolution of hands and wrists
			Cultural evolution and the development of tools has been influenced by the biological evolution of hominins
			As we became bipedal, our hands were freed up to do lots of tasks
			Over time, hominin hands have developed longer thumbs, changing our grip on objects
			Wrists have also developed the ability to extend further than other hominoids, giving hominins more motion and better leverage when using tools
			Tool use and development is greatly influenced by hand and wrist structures
