Evolutionary theory predicts that related organisms will share similarities that are derived from common ancestors 
Similar characteristics due to relatedness are known as homologies 
Homologies can be revealed by:
	Comparing the anatomies of different living things 
	Looking at cellular similarities and differences 
	Studying embryological development
	Studying vestigial structures within individual organisms
Structural morphology
	Comparative anatomy
		Individual organisms contain, within their bodies, abundant evidence of their history
		The existence of these features is explained by evoloution
		Organisms that are closely related to one another share many anatomical similarities
	Homologous structures
		Similar structures are called homologous structures that can be traced back to a similar set of genes inherited over time. They have a fundamental similarity but may have different functions
		This is often evidence for divergent evolution where the one common ancestral group splits into distinct species with their own variations of a feature
	Transitional fossils
		Transition fossils in the fossil record can show intermediates of homologous structures, demonstrating the evolution of structural intermediates 
		Homologous structures do not change dramatically overnight and transitional fossils demonstrate the slow evolution of traits 
	Analogous structures
		Analogous structures share a function but cannot be tracked to the same or similar genes for their similarity
		For example wings serve the same function but have vastly different structures between different species
		This illustrates convergent evolution as unrelated species have become structurally more alike due to exposure to shared selection pressures
	Vestigial structures
		Structures that may have served an evolutionary purpose in the past but are no longer used
		An example are wings on a flightless bird.
