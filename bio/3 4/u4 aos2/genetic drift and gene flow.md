Allele frequencies over time
	Genetic drift
		Occurs due to random chance events such as births and deaths
		Genetic drift has the greatest impact on small populations which have little to no gene flow 
		When an individual dies, there is a significant impact on allele frequencies
		Generally, genetic drift results in a loss of genetic diversity in a gene pool over time â†’ Genetic drift can lead to the decrease, and eventual loss, of favourable alleles from the gene pool
		Types of genetic drift
			Both of these events result in changes to the allele frequency in a gene pool by random chance
			The result of these events creates new populations that are unrepresentative of the original gene pool![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUdmNi7zuTGE0BOtItGmQmv7k_QH9TDgH9646aKvWYFhDj8m3P-Lp_lz5XoulscZ7YRuUCjnlkeFOdDnHfYJ0P0eWLer6tOJG_z95QXXmo1Vx4TS9Dv39nlDjW9LgaqbuY04nMOL4EQ9PObYzEFrAPJuu5Qy9IsoKt-rNZJuLzVibRGvpvQnLQ=s2048?key=q4rbtvujX7ss78GmBP9-HQ)
			Bottleneck effect
				When a major event causes the widespread loss of a population, the surviving few will contribute their genes to the next generation 
				The surviving gene pool may be unrepresentative sample of the original population
				The bottleneck effect is an extreme example of genetic drift that happens when the size of a population is severely reduced. 
				Events like natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires) can decimate a population, killing most individuals and leaving behind a small, random assortment of survivors.
				The allele frequencies in this group may be very different from those of the population prior to the event, and some alleles may be missing entirely. 
				The smaller population will also be more susceptible to the effects of genetic drift for generations (until its numbers return to normal), potentially causing even more alleles to be lost.

			Founder effect
				When an environment is unfavourable for survival, individuals of a population may emigrate out of the original environment and into a new, more favourable one
				This founder population will be the representatives of this species in the new region
				When the new colonisers are unrepresentative of the original population and then pass on their genes in this new gene pool, this isa type of genetic drift known as the founder effect

		Summary

	Gene flow
		Gene flow is the movement of alleles from one population to another
		It is often confused as only referring to migration of members in or out of an area
		In reality, gene flow can occur without the movement of individuals (such as pollination of plants from a great distance or artificial insemination of animals)
		The most important thing is that alleles are introduced to or removed from a gene pool in some way by fertile individuals or their gametes

		The gain or loss of alleles as a result of gene flow tends to reduce the differences in genetic variation between gene pools
		Gene flow can increase the genetic diversity of a gene pool by adding new alleles
		Similarly, it can remove the genetic variation of a gene pool if fertile members migrate out of the area
		If a population has no gene flow with other populations, it can become genetically isolated and be at risk of inbreeding if their gene pool has little variation
		Blocking gene flow between populations is also how speciation occurs where populations diverge into distinct groups that cannot mate with each other
