Allele frequencies over time
	Genetic drift
		Occurs due to random chance events such as births and deaths
		Genetic drift has the greatest impact on small populations which have little to no gene flow 
		When an individual dies, there is a significant impact on allele frequencies
		Generally, genetic drift results in a loss of genetic diversity in a gene pool over time â†’ Genetic drift can lead to the decrease, and eventual loss, of favourable alleles from the gene pool
		Types of genetic drift
			Both of these events result in changes to the allele frequency in a gene pool by random chance
			The result of these events creates new populations that are unrepresentative of the original gene pool![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUdmNi7zuTGE0BOtItGmQmv7k_QH9TDgH9646aKvWYFhDj8m3P-Lp_lz5XoulscZ7YRuUCjnlkeFOdDnHfYJ0P0eWLer6tOJG_z95QXXmo1Vx4TS9Dv39nlDjW9LgaqbuY04nMOL4EQ9PObYzEFrAPJuu5Qy9IsoKt-rNZJuLzVibRGvpvQnLQ=s2048?key=q4rbtvujX7ss78GmBP9-HQ)
			Bottleneck effect
				When a major event causes the widespread loss of a population, the surviving few will contribute their genes to the next generation 
				The surviving gene pool may be unrepresentative sample of the original population
				The bottleneck effect is an extreme example of genetic drift that happens when the size of a population is severely reduced. 
				Events like natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires) can decimate a population, killing most individuals and leaving behind a small, random assortment of survivors.
				The allele frequencies in this group may be very different from those of the population prior to the event, and some alleles may be missing entirely. 
				The smaller population will also be more susceptible to the effects of genetic drift for generations (until its numbers return to normal), potentially causing even more alleles to be lost.
