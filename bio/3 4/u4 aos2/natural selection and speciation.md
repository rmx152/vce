Natural selection
	The genetic diversity between individuals in a population results in different phenotypes (traits) that have varying advantages for survival and reproduction
	Individuals who are well-suited to their environment are more likely to survive and then go on to reproduce. This is known as natural selection
	Natural selection relies on reproduction to pass on advantageous alleles and see the frequency of these alleles increase in the gene pool
	Traits that are not well-suited to the environment will result in the individuals with this trait not reproducing to keep this allele in the gene pool
	Natural selection results in the survival of the fittest in a population
	The ‘fittest’ does not mean the strongest, but the best adapted variation for the environment 
		sometimes the best adaptation can still face selection though
	Selection pressures, like competition for resources, temperature, food sources and suitable mating partners can select out the alleles that would give a population the greater chance for long term survival
	Selection pressures
		Selection pressures are abiotic or biotic factors that influence the survival of an organism
		Environmental selection pressures can affect individuals in a population differently for a number of reasons:
			Genetic diversity – some phenotypes are more suited for the environment
			Reproduction – some individuals have greater reproductive success
			Survival – individuals have different rates of survival and not all survive long enough to reproduce
	Natural selection is the process by which species adapt to their environment
		leads to evolutionary change as the gene pool is represented by alleles from surviving individuals
	Evolution refers to changes in groups of living things over time
	Individual members of a population grow and develop, but they don’t evolve 
		They pass on their genetic material to the next generation, where lots of genetic changes can slowly develop as evolution of a trait or characteristic in the gene pool

	Adaptations
		Variation occurs as a result of mutations that create new alleles which can be inherited by the next generation
		Well-adapted individuals are those which have inherited characteristics such as the ability to avoid predators, compete strongly for food, or resist disease 
			They survive and reproduce, passing on the genes that make them successful. They are said to have a selective advantage
		Natural selection ensures that most members of a species are well-adapted to their environment
		Selective advantages
			Depending on the environment, what is considered a selective advantage can vary.
			Besides physical traits, behavioural adaptations can also increase the odds of survival.
			Tool use and social behaviours in animals have greatly increased the survival of some species 
				one of the reasons why humans have become such a dominant species.
			Selective advantages aid in survival, however unless a suitable mate can be found, evolution through the process of natural selection cannot occur.
		Defence against predators
			Organisms have developed various defences against attack from predators.
			Defences that are successful are passed onto the next generation, either genetically or by learning.
			Over time, defences become more sophisticated 
				if the defences are genetically coded, the mutated gene will become more prevalent in the population
		Ecological niche
			Specific role, location, and food source, that a species occupies to minimise competition
		Darwinism
			Individuals in a species show a wide range of variation
			This variation is because of differences in genes.
			Individuals with characteristics most suited to the environment in which they live are more likely to survive and reproduce.
			The genes that allowed the individuals to be successful are passed to the offspring in the next generation.
			Individuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce. This means that their genes are less likely to be passed to the next generation. 
			Given enough time, a species will gradually evolve.

Speciation
	A species is a group of organisms able to interbreed and produce fertile offspring
	As long as a population has the opportunity to interbreed and exchange genes, they remain one species 
		natural selection can give variation amongst the members but they still remain the same species
	A population of one species can only evolve into more than one species if groups within the population become isolated from each other by barriers that prevent exchange of genes (gene flow)
	Isolating barriers and speciation
		Isolating barriers can stop gene flow, which is needed for speciation
		Barriers can exist before reproduction (pre-zygotic) or after reproduction (post-zygotic).

		Types of speciation
			Allopatric speciation (speciation due to geographical separation of groups)
				Blocks gene flow using geographical barriers
				As this group is isolated, there is increased breeding between the members that live nearby
				The allele frequency in the new gene pool can be changed dramatically depending on factors such as reproduction rate, dominant or recessive traits, and the selective advantage of phenotypes
				With enough genetic changes to the population over time, speciation can occur where members of old common species can no longer reproduce and have fertile offspring with this new group if they were reintroduced to each other

			Sympatric speciation (speciation in the same geographical area)
				Populations of a species are not geographically isolated from each other but still develop to become reproductively isolated from each other
				More common in plant species than animals
				In the one geographical area, a new variation might occur that changes a particular phenotype of a small population (a polymorphism)
				Those with this phenotype will undergo non-random mating, preferring to mate with those that also have this phenotype. There is a reduction in gene flow as a result
				Over time, this population accumulates genetic differences that passes from generation to generation of offspring until this group has cannot interbreed with the original population any longer 
				Plants
					In plants, the most common cause of sympatric speciation is through polyploidy
					During abnormal cell division, the gametes of a parent species might have extra sets of chromosomes (for example, parents might produce diploid 2N gametes instead of haploid N gametes)
					The mutation means that the individual can still reproduce successfully through self-fertilisation or other asexual reproductive methods
					However the polyploid species is unlikely to successfully reproduce with the original parent species that is not polyploid
				Howea Plants
					Because the island is so small, it is considered impossible to have true geographical isolation between populations on the island
					Researchers have concluded that sympatric speciation was driven by the flowering times of the different palms, which was affected by the differing soil pH that they grew in. H. forsteriana prefers alkaline pH soils such as calcarenite, whilst H. belmorana prefers acidic or neutral pH soils such as volcanic soil

Evolving pathogens
	bacteria and viruses undergo changes in their genetic composition and can evolve over time
	Bacterial resistance to antibiotics
		Evolve to be antibiotic via natural selection
		1. Some members of the population have a gene variation that allows them to survive a particular antibiotic
		2. When the antibiotic is introduced, it acts as an environmental selection pressure, killing those without the antibiotic resistance gene.
		3. The bacteria with the antibiotic resistance gene survive and reproduce to produce offspring that have the antibiotic resistance gene and will not be killed by this antibiotic

	Viral evolution
		Due to their rapid reproduction inside host cells, viruses are at risk of mutations
		As mutations accumulate, there may be changes to key proteins in a virus, such as surface antigens
		This is concerning as many viral treatments and defences humans have rely on antigens being a particular shape for these defences to be effective
		Viruses can change their antigens via two mechanisms:
			Antigenic drift
				Antigenic drift involves continual small changes or mutations to a virus’s surface antigens 
				Think of a small boat drifting across the ocean or clouds drifting across the sky. These changes produce new viral strains that are fairly closely related to one another and may be recognized by the immune system (sometimes called “cross-protection”)
				Changes due to antigenic drift can nevertheless accumulate over time, straining the ability of a person’s immune system to recognize the new virus.
				![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUckgoaWen1Il8Xjyfm2spL1oTT6-zO-EejqAFw9MbkXRg7v1OXPZFAchZYav_vAgeWSJhdTZOSd_YRbpLp7oWUeZiyorY9DPOUFJ1rhL0B9y-ddpZ_h9EVyRWokt7j4iBsdROJ2GPmCdqJXpz8zTb-hAQhZMBMw_qfpCTQeNOgTnDFdkV2xmHg=s2048?key=APc0tr2eZKgL9IK88m4NBg)
			Antigenic shift
				Antigenic shift is a major, abrupt change in one or multiple surface antigens. 
				Shift occurs at varying intervals and likely is the result of reassortment (the exchange of a gene segment) between two viral strains, usually those that affect different species
				Antigenic shift is more likely to cause pandemics as there is no cross-protection and drastic changes in antigen shape, requiring brand new vaccines and often testing methods for the new sub-type of the virus

		Challenges for disease treatments and vaccines
			Antibiotic resistance can result in drug resistant bacterial strains that cannot be treated using antibiotics that don’t cause harm to the human body
			Vaccines rely on the formation of an immune response against target antigens. From there, antibodies and memory B cells are made against this target antigen shape
			As pathogens mutate, vaccines against a particular target antigen may no longer work as the antibodies and memory B cells produced cannot recognise the new variant of the pathogen
			New vaccines would need to be developed against the new strains of pathogen
			Similarly, antiviral medication that targets specific surface antigens or protein shapes may be rendered ineffective if a virus mutates dramatically that the medication can no longer bind
