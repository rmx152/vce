Fossils
	Fossils are the 'remains' of organisms from many years ago, which are found in rocks. Fossils may be formed in various ways:
		From the hard parts of animals that do not decay easily. 
		From parts of organisms that have not decayed because one or more of the conditions needed for decay are absent.
		When parts of the organism are replaced by other materials as they decay. 
		As preserved traces of organisms, e.g. footprints, burrows and rootlet traces.
	Types of fossils
		Permineralized fossils
			Organic tissue is replaced by hardened rock over time
		Impression fossils
			No organic matter from the dead organism
			Hardened rock preserves shape of the organism
				Footprints filled in with hardened materials
		Trace fossils
			Activates of the organism are preserved
				Faeces
				Burrows
				Nests
		Mummified fossils
			Not found in sedimentary rock
			The body of the organism is trapped somewhere to slow decomposition
				Trapped in resin
				Frozen in ice
				Found in dry caves
	Fossil formation
		Fossilisation only happens in the rarest of cases, when a plant or animal dies in the right circumstances
		Lack of oxygen slows down decomposition
		Needs to be protected from scavengers/decomposers and the elements
		Minerals from the rocks gradually impregnate the bone, shell or even wood changing its chemical composition
		In cases where the original has dissolved away, the minerals can gradually fill the hollow to create a natural cast of the original
		Eventually the rock enclosing a fossil is eroded away, and the fossil is revealed on the surface of the ground
		Steps of fossilisation
			1. The organism dies
			2. The body of the organism is rapidly burned in sediment in a low oxygen environment
			3. Hard tissues of body is gradually impregnated by mineral as soft tissues decompose

	Fossilisation bias
		Fossilisation is more likely to occur if organisms have hard parts to preserve such as shells, teeth, and bones 
		The habitat and the habits of any organism can also have a dramatic effect on the chances of becoming fossilised
		Soft tissues do not fossilise as well and it’s rare to get a suitable cast of the soft tissue surrounding fossilised bones, requiring a lot of guesswork over structures like musculature, skin, fur and feathers
		Similarly, soft bodied organisms like worms and jellyfish are very rarely found as fossils
	Fossils supporting evolution
		Fossils of the simplest organisms are found in the oldest rocks, and fossils of more complex organisms in the newest rocks. 
		This supports the theory of evolution, which states that simple life forms gradually evolved into more complex ones.
		F.A.R.M. – Fish become Amphibians become Reptiles become Mammals. (Important to note that reptiles also evolve into Birds)

	Transitional fossils 
		If a new species arises by evolution from an ancestral species, there should be fossils that are an intermediate between species 
		These transitional fossils are key in tracking the gradual evolution of species over time. New species do not appear randomly.
		The first evidence of reptile to bird evolution was found in 1861 in a limestone quarry in Bavaria, Germany
		The fossil is known as Archaeopteryx lithographica and it shows feather impressions and a wishbone as well as reptilian features no longer seen in birds, like teeth, claws on wings and a long bony tail
	Cyanobacteria 
		Because most single-celled life is soft and decays easily, fossils of single-celled organisms are usually rare. 
		Cyanobacteria are larger than most bacteria, and may secrete a thick cell wall. More importantly, cyanobacteria may form large layered structures, called stromatolites
		When sectioned very thinly, fossil stromatolites may be found to contain preserved fossil cyanobacteria and algae
Dating techniques
	Absolute dating
		establishes how many years ago a given event took place. The most important methods of absolute dating are based on the decay of naturally occurring radioactive elements
	Relative dating 
		places historical events in their correct order but does not yield numerical estimates of how many years ago the events happened
	Fossil succession and relative dating
		Fossils can be dated by determining the age of the rock layer (strata) in which the fossil is found
			Sedimentary rock layers develop in a chronological order, such that lower layers are older and newer strata form on top
			Each strata represents a variable length of time that is classified according to a geological time scale (eons, eras, periods)
		Different kinds of organisms are found in rocks of particular ages in a consistent order, indicating a sequence of development
			Prokaryotes appear in the fossil record before eukaryotes
			Ferns appear in the fossil record before flowering plants
			Invertebrates appear in the fossil record before vertebrate species
		This chronological sequence of complexity by which characteristics appear to develop is known as the law of fossil succession. This ordered succession of fossils suggests that newer species likely evolved as a result of changes to ancestral species
	Index fossils and relative age
		Index fossils
			similar fossils from separate locations
		Index fossils are used to determine relative age (age the fossil was formed).
			 Not precise.
		Characteristics for identification:
			Easily Recognizable 
			Widespread = The fossil must show up in each of the different outcrops (columns).
			Short Lived = Within each outcrop, the fossil can only appear in one layer (row).
	Radiometric dating
		Radioactive atoms are inherently unstable; over time, radioactive ‘parent atoms’ decay into stable ‘daughter atoms’
		When molten rock cools, forming what are called igneous rocks, radioactive atoms are trapped inside 
		Afterwards, they decay at a predictable rate 
		By measuring the quantity of unstable atoms left in a rock and comparing it to the quantity of stable daughter atoms in the rock, scientists can estimate the amount of time that has passed since that rock formed. This is a type of absolute aging

		Different radioisotopes can be used depending on the predicted relative age of the rock or fossil 
			Potassium-40 has a half life of 1.3 billion years and can date igneous rock 100,000 years 
			Uranium (many types) can range in half life from 700 million years to 4.5 billion years. Can date anything from 1 million years 
			Carbon-14 gives the absolute age of organic samples 1,000 - 50,000 years old
			(Do not need to memorise dates)

		Carbon dating
			Carbon-14 (parent isotope) decays into the stable Nitrogen-14 (daughter isotope)
			That makes the half-life far too short for dating material that is millions of years old
