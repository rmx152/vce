DNA manipulation and modification
	Cutting up DNA
		Restriction enzymes, a type of endonuclease. are used to modify DNA
			These enzymes cut DNA at specific sequences
			Restriction enzymes are selective and will only recognise certain sequences and cut at those sites
				it recognises sequences due to the shape of the active site, which only binds to a specific substrate
			Endonucleases are a general term for enzymes that cut the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA
			Restriction enzymes are named according to the bacterial species they are derived from
			Restriction enzymes restrict viral replication by cutting viral DNA
		Bacterial plasmids
			Plasmids are self replicating circular DNA molecules that are separate from the bacterial chromosome
			Carries certain genes that are not necessary for basic life functions but can provide a survival advantage (for example: antibiotic resistance) 
				Can be transferred from one bacterium to another
			Are passed onto new cells produced by binary fission
			Contains sites for restriction enzymes to cut![[bacterial plasmid.png]]
		Fragment ends
			Restriction enzymes attach and cut the DNA out
				This process is known as cleavage
			The resulting ends can have overhanging exposed sequences with no base pair
				This is a sticky end
				Can only be recombined with sticky ends
				This is preferred over blunt ends as blunt ends can be joined together in the wrong orientation
			The cut can be clean and result in no overhanging area
				This is a blunt end
				Can only be recombined with blunt ends
			![[sticky blunt.png]]
		Fragment sizes 
			As a plasmid is a circle, we can use the total number of base pairs in the plasmid and the location and number of fragments to deduce the size of fragments
			If only one cut is made in the plasmid, the total size of the fragment will be equal to the total number of base pairs![[fragment sizes.png]]
		DNA ligase
			Sticky end fragments have exposed sequences that can pair up with a complementary fragment with the right sticky end
			Exposed sticky ends form weak hydrogen bonds between the base pairs
			DNA ligase is needed to create bonds between the phosphate sugar backbone to glue the fragments together
			Creates a phosphodiester bond between DNA
		Bacterial transformation
			Transformation = the uptake of a recombinant plasmid into bacterial cells.
			This process rarely occurs naturally 
				bacterial cell walls and membranes prevent the plasmid from entering as they are negatively charged, (DNA has a phosphate back bone) repelling each other
			Plasmids can enter bacteria by adding calcium ions and using different temperature that heat shocks the bacteria and creates adhesion zones where the plasmid can enter
			We can also apply short high voltage pulses to overcome the barrier of the cell membrane
				this is known as electroporation

		Gene cloning
			Bacteria reproduce rapidly
				binary fission
			Makes them ideal to produce large amounts of target proteins in a short time 
				recombinant plasmids transform bacteria to produce human insulin that is harvested for medical use
		Identifying bacterial transformation
			A recombinant plasmid can be checked by adding extra genes that help select cells that have been successfully transformed
			Genes that added often
				Antibiotic existence genes
					helps bacteria survive a particular antibiotic
				Reporter genes
					genes added in the plasmid before the gene of interest. Reporter genes can either be cut by the gene of interest so this can indicate if the DNA is now recombinant or can indicate if the target plasmid was taken up
				Selecting out transformed bacteria
					Antibiotics are chemicals that kill bacteria
					A selective medium such as agar that has a particular antibiotic in it will kill all bacteria that do not have a recombinant plasmid with the antibiotic resistance gene
					The surviving bacteria will grow in colonies and will all have the gene of interest inside of them
					We can then grow these bacteria on a separate agar plate to to harvest proteins made from the gene of interest

Outline the steps of making a recombinant plasmid (3 marks)
	(1) A restriction enzyme cuts a plasmid at a recognition site, creating blunt or sticky ends
	(2) The same restriction enzyme would cut the gene of interest
	(3) The target gene is inserted into the plasmid at the complementary ends and DNA ligase will create phosphodiester bonds between the DNA fragments

Producing insulin
	Insulin is an essential hormone produced by the pancreas to reduce high blood glucose levels in the blood
	Insulin has an A chain (21 amino acids) and a B chain (30 amino acids) which are linked together by a disulfide bond
	It is a quaternary structure
	**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/U_taG-fmi1kSaeVfVQLYmtfhsdOfL0aflGi6GS6FtOo_wnh2jcyPgNk5kjpPrY0O2BnmyL3BVoINQ8WaxnSyFl3IF6-owFJvqQkvRJLGyw35zTqhNU-s9Vi1EzuF9KJdbdqxi6Ribh9iwLk=s2048)**
	Manufacturing insulin
			Two different insulin polypeptides are inserted next to a gene for β-galactosidase protein in two different plasmids in two separate bacterial cells
			Introns need to be removed from the human genes for these insulin polypeptides prior to insertion into the plasmid because bacteria does not have a mechanism to remove introns
			**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hGafEfpfHbV-1vylK8q5-hOYfFtIi-m7iE72oxcylupfsTl7nXxLlIMrzuyU9iBQZA8f-wEMwhvbAh4nd77WUi_Q1YHtZx1_NZTT7Wbo-JCrHA-euLFBZ4x0uqHC0SuWiQBZxk9D7CBNBbM=s2048)**
			The plasmid
				Two recombinant plasmid vectors must be made, one for insulin subunit B and one for insulin subunit A
				The following must be tested
					Which bacteria has taken up a plasmid (recombinant or not)
					Whether the plasmid has successfully taken up the target gene to become a recombinant plasmid
					Whether the bacteria has taken up the recombinant plasmid and become successfully transformed
				To do this, we use a plasmid that has two antibiotic resistance genes, AmpR (ampicillin resistance) and TetR (tetracycline resistance)
				The BamHI restriction enzyme used to cut this plasmid will interrupt the TetR gene if the target gene is correctly inserted into this plasmid
				**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rvXW-lEdjIRNdG23d68CnXIN2a8m1Ksbv7dtBXc1KJx1g55fJa_6cV7fuGzNXg2hDBkd3jTOrm06gcGvpmrHiD8BhNJwsOiB6WeG9DKOmOaUD9RbImryXuImA2drH4BEZ7RZIuUskW7FiRI=s2048)**
				Inserting the insulin gene
						The plasmid vector is cut with BamHI which has a recognition site inside the TetR gene and insulin subunit genes are added
						The plasmids are added to a solution of E. coli, some of which will take up the plasmid, either normal or recombinant. We can test if E. coli has taken up a plasmid by growing it on an agar plate with ampicillin. Those with no plasmid will die and no colonies will form. 
						If this recognition site is cut and the insulin subunit gene inserts, then any bacteria that take up this recombinant plasmid will no longer be tetracycline resistant. 
							To test this, a small sample from surviving ampicilin colonies is taken, and grown on a plate with tetracycline. Those on the plate with tetracycline that die will have the recombinant plasmid. The TetR gene acts as a reporter gene. ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GH22yCk1dxMxjssByUva_Ne2TyjzpoRObiugo_M4iT0AIdSMAD-Rq_62VbdMAaiBJ0VC1LaQfCd6wjfxXsWGScKmAb2atZ7gdXaAv6vlovD--kRlLx-98iDzWV4FAa2OcBrVMlzegTGHIvk=s2048)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1Gm_ph7GW-KiDUJhYpCz6CM7wicAgZ1Yy6dmd0WMShjpgy-LBmKvEhVA2Ngv_HZV5RyUfrpjsvswBRrm96yOp741-OhGxGFlLdNOLcoKUPbRJ6RQ6Xc9emvy8Ca5Q_4Ef-bb4kY12n9-SLw=s2048)
						Making a fusion protein
							To increase the production of the insulin subunit polypeptide chains, we can insert another gene next to the target insulin gene
							This is inserted at the EcoRI recognition site and places the gene LacZ next to the insulin subunit gene
							LacZ is a gene for the enzyme β-galactosidase. As this enzyme is transcribed and translated, the insulin gene is also transcribed and translated (promotes transcription of the insulin genes)
							The protein that is made is a fusion protein of the β-galactosidase and insulin gene is protected from enzyme digestion by E. coli that might damage the insulin protein (very important)
							![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YYrdmGONWlM60hYiVqmKgSaQcXdfz0LCQ0yxN4-4nQGZwvda5LMP9OaTSLd4_J9BacbtFPV8tVQMMi0lkThD_MJk2SPmUz3ia0VBaD_2z-34Zec9c50wq36OUXQRLRJNrOQgG5GJPbvaVwk=s2048)
						Final bacterial transformation
							We finally need to get the recombinant plasmid for the insulin fusion protein into E. coli for rapid growth of transformed cells and large scale production of the fusion protein
							To do this, we mix the recombinant plasmid with our bacterial cells
							We then grow all the bacterial cells on an agar plate that contains ampicillin and a compound called X-gal:
								Ampicillin kills any bacterial cell that has no plasmid in it
								X-gal turns any cell with the β-galactosidase enzyme (aka any transformed cell with the recombinant plasmid) a bright blue colour

GMOs and Agriculture
	GMOs are any organisms (including bacteria) that have had their genomes altered in some way
	Many techniques exist for genetic modifications and each have their pros and cons
		Note that not all GMOs are transgenic. Only those with genes from another species are classified as transgenic![[gmos.png]]
	GMO crops can produce plants and animals that have a number of advantageous traits over unmodified organisms
		Drought resistance
		Pesticide and herbicide resistance
		Increased yield
		Disease and pest resistance (such as Bt corn which kills pests that eat corn)
		Enriched plants with proteins needed to synthesise vitamins (Golden rice helps make enzymes that build vitamin A)
	Issues surrounding GMOs
		The use of GMOs in agriculture has a large number of benefits, but is still widely debated in the wider community especially as they are used for human consumption
	We can consider the impact of the following factors in each issue
		Social factors
		Economic factors
		Political factors
		Legal factors
