DNA manipulation and modification
	Cutting up DNA
		Restriction enzymes, a type of endonuclease. are used to modify DNA
			These enzymes cut DNA at specific sequences
			Restriction enzymes are selective and will only recognise certain sequences and cut at those sites
				it recognises sequences due to the shape of the active site, which only binds to a specific substrate
			Endonucleases are a general term for enzymes that cut the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA
			Restriction enzymes are named according to the bacterial species they are derived from
			Restriction enzymes restrict viral replication by cutting viral DNA
		Bacterial plasmids
			Plasmids are self replicating circular DNA molecules that are separate from the bacterial chromosome
			Carries certain genes that are not necessary for basic life functions but can provide a survival advantage (for example: antibiotic resistance) 
				Can be transferred from one bacterium to another
			Are passed onto new cells produced by binary fission
			Contains sites for restriction enzymes to cut![[bacterial plasmid.png]]
		Fragment ends
			Restriction enzymes attach and cut the DNA out
				This process is known as cleavage
			The resulting ends can have overhanging exposed sequences with no base pair
				This is a sticky end
				Can only be recombined with sticky ends
				This is preferred over blunt ends as blunt ends can be joined together in the wrong orientation
			The cut can be clean and result in no overhanging area
				This is a blunt end
				Can only be recombined with blunt ends

		Fragment sizes 
			As a plasmid is a circle, we can use the total number of base pairs in the plasmid and the location and number of fragments to deduce the size of fragments
			If only one cut is made in the plasmid, the total size of the fragment will be equal to the total number of base pairs![[fragment sizes.png]]
		DNA ligase
			Sticky end fragments have exposed sequences that can pair up with a complementary fragment with the right sticky end
			Exposed sticky ends form weak hydrogen bonds between the base pairs
			DNA ligase is needed to create bonds between the phosphate sugar backbone to glue the fragments together
			Creates a phosphodiester bond between DNA
		Bacterial transformation
			Transformation = the uptake of a recombinant plasmid into bacterial cells.
			This process rarely occurs naturally 
				bacterial cell walls and membranes prevent the plasmid from entering as they are negatively charged, (DNA has a phosphate back bone) repelling each other
			Plasmids can enter bacteria by adding calcium ions and using different temperature that heat shocks the bacteria and creates adhesion zones where the plasmid can enter
			We can also apply short high voltage pulses to overcome the barrier of the cell membrane
				this is known as electroporation

		Gene cloning
			Bacteria reproduce rapidly
				binary fission
			Makes them ideal to produce large amounts of target proteins in a short time 
				recombinant plasmids transform bacteria to produce human insulin that is harvested for medical use
		Identifying bacterial transformation
			A recombinant plasmid can be checked by adding extra genes that help select cells that have been successfully transformed
			Genes that added often
				Antibiotic existence genes
					helps bacteria survive a particular antibiotic
				Reporter genes
					genes added in the plasmid before the gene of interest. Reporter genes can either be cut by the gene of interest so this can indicate if the DNA is now recombinant or can indicate if the target plasmid was taken up
				Selecting out transformed bacteria
					Antibiotics are chemicals that kill bacteria
					A selective medium such as agar that has a particular antibiotic in it will kill all bacteria that do not have a recombinant plasmid with the antibiotic resistance gene
					The surviving bacteria will grow in colonies and will all have the gene of interest inside of them
					We can then grow these bacteria on a separate agar plate to to harvest proteins made from the gene of interest

Outline the steps of making a recombinant plasmid (3 marks)
	(1) A restriction enzyme cuts a plasmid at a recognition site, creating blunt or sticky ends
	(2) The same restriction enzyme would cut the gene of interest
	(3) The target gene is inserted into the plasmid at the complementary ends and DNA ligase will create phosphodiester bonds between the DNA fragments
