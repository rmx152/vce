- DNA contains the instructions for every protein, cellular process and structural components within an organism
- Nucleic acids (DNA+RNA) are polymers composed of a specific sequence of many nucleotides (monomers)
- Monomer of DNA is made up of:
    - A phosphate molecule
    - Deoxyribose sugar
    - Nitrogenous base (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine)
    - ![[DNA monomer.png]]
- Monomer of RNA is made up of
    - A phosphate
    - Ribose sugar
    - Nitrogenous base (Adenine, Uracil, Cytosine, Guanine)
- Numbering of carbon
    - Base will pair to the 1st carbon
    - Phosphate will pair to the 5th carbon
- DNA vs RNA
    - RNA has ribose, DNA has deoxyribose (1 less oxygen than ribose)
    - DNA is double stranded, RNA is single stranded
    - RNA does not contain thymine, it is replaced by uracil![[DNA v RNA.png]]
- Adenine and Guanine are purines, due to two rings
- Pyrimidines are Thymine and Cytosine, containing only one ring
- Nucleotides join to form a polymer (single strand of DNA)
- The phosphate group of one nucleotide covalently (shares electrons) bonds with the deoxyribose sugar of the next nucleotide
- Condensation polymerisation reaction (one water molecule is released every time)
- DNA and RNA are directional (the end with the free phosphate is the 5' end)
- DNA is double stranded
    - Two nucleotide polymers join to form a double stranded molecule
    - This occurs due to hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases
    - Complementary base pairing rule:
        - A bonds with T or U (in RNA) - two hydrogen bonds
        - C bounds with G - three hydrogen bonds
    - DNA strands are anti parallel

- RNA
    - 3 types of RNA in all cells
        - Messenger RNA (mRNA)
            - Transcribed from DNA
            - Enables the genetic info decoded in DNA to reach a ribosome where it can be translated into protein
            - Complementary copy of the DNA
        - Transfer RNA (tRNA)
            - Carries amino acids to ribosomes during translation
            - Has an amino acid binding site at one end and an anti-codon at the other
        - Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
            - The structural component of ribosome
            - Produced in the nucleolus
        ![[RNA types.png]]
- Genetic code
    - Gene: a segment of DNA that codes/instructs for a certain polypeptide's production
    - 3 consecutive bases in DNA = triplet
        - DNA triplet gets transcribed into a RNA codon (three consecutive RNA bases)
        - Each RNA codon codes for one amino acid
        - Each codon is translated into a sequences of amino acids to be joined together into a polypeptide (protein) chain
        - Therefore, each DNA triplet codes for one amino acid molecule to be inserted into a polypeptide
    - ![[amino acids.png]]
    - More than one triplet can code for the same amino acid molecule, therefore we refer to DNA as degenerate (redundant)
    - There are stop triplets/codons that don't code for any amino acid but instead designate where the polypeptide chain ends
    - There is a start triplet, TAC (codon AUG), which always codes for the amino acid methionine and designates the beginning of the protein molecule
    - Eukaryotic DNA is stored as chromosomes within the nucleus
        - Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes
        - Chromosomes are made of tightly condensed chromatin
        - Chromatic is composed of DNA wrapped around histone proteins
        - ![[chromosomes.png]]
    - Prokaryotic DNA is ground in a singular circular chromosome contained in a central area known as the nucleoid
        - Prokaryotic DNA does not contain histones
        - Prokaryotes contain small circular pieces of DNA called plasmids
