- Polymerase Chain Reaction
    - PCR is a molecular technique where DNA is amplified (copied)
    - Essential for large quantities of DNA
    - Parts
        - DNA primers
            - Short single stranded DNA segments that are complementary to part of the section of DNA that is going to be copied
        - DNA nucleotides
            - Synthesise new DNA strands
        - Taq polymerase
            - DNA polymerase from the bacteria Thermus aquaticus
                - Can withstand high temperatures, which is required for PCR 
        - The DNA sample
    - Steps
        - The PCR mix containing the DNA sample is heated to 95 degrees Celsius
            - Denaturation: The heat energy breaks the hydrogen bonds between the strands of DNA causing them to dissociate and become single stranded  
        - The sample is then cooled to 55 degrees Celsius
            - Annealing: The primers are now able to anneal to the single stranded DNA
        - The sample is heated back up to 72 degrees Celsius
            - Elongation: This temperature allows the Taq polymerase to synthesise new DNA strands utilising the primers
        - The process is repeated many times
            - Creates larger quantities of DNA
    - Applications
        - Forensics
        - Genetic testing
        - Identification of pathogens
        - Research
- Gel Electrophoresis
    - A process often conducted following PCR that allows DNA molecules to be sorted based on their molecular weight/size
    - It moves to the positive side because phosphate is negatively charged. A loading buffer is also used because the slight negative charge will migrate the same direction as DNA, allowing users to monitor the progress of molecules moving through the gel
    - A dye tracker is added that is mutagenic and fluorescent which allows it to bind to the DNA and be visible under UV light.
    - Steps
        - DNA samples are loaded into wells in the gel
        - An electric charge is being run through the gel (negative electrode at the wells, positive electrode opposite to the wells)
        - The DNA moves towards the positive end
        - The gel is porous, and the DNA must move through these pores, therefore larger/longer segments of DNA move more slowly than smaller pieces, allowing the segments to separate out based on size
        - Fragments are stained so that they can be seen 
    - Applications
        - Forensics
        - Paternity/Maternity tests
        - Genetic testing
- DNA profiling
    - DNA is unique (other than identical twins, who contain the same genotype)
    - Unique segments we use for DNA profiling are called short tandem repeats (microsatellites)
    - STRs
        - They are certain segments in our DNA containing repetitions of ~3-5 base pairs
        - These STRs can contain anywhere from 5 to >100 repeats
        - These are found at many deferent loci in our genome
        - They are often found between two individuals, however the difference is the number of repeats
        - The different number of repeats of different alleles are considered
    - In Australia our forensic investigations use 9 STR loci and a sex marker in order to identify individuals through DNA profiling
        - The more loci used, the more accurate
        - Each STR loci may have many alleles, each allele contains a different number of repeats
    - The process is highly accurate, with the chance of two people having the same genotype improbable
    - Procedure
        - Take a DNA sample from the individual and preform PCR on the sample
            - The primers used are designed to copy the DNA segments at the specific STR loci
        - Separate by size DNA fragments using gel electrophoresis
        - Use different fluorescent markers to identify the alleles of each STR locus
        - Can therefore determine the genotype of the individual at each locus
            - All of the genotypes together make up the DNA profile of the individual
