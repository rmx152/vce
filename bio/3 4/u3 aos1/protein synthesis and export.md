Protein synthesis
	Transcription
		How does DNA make protein?
			The sequence of nitrogenous bases (adenine thymine guanine and cytosine) that make up a gene can be copied as short segments of RNA
			RNA is a type of nucleic acid similar to DNA
				RNA contains a ribose sugar instead of a deoxyribose sugar
				RNA has uracil instead of thymine
				Uracil pairs with adenine
				RNA is short and single stranded
			For a rRNA template
			 to be made the double helix of DNA unzips, exposing a strand of DNA
			Free nucleotides bind with the exposed bases and from a chain of messenger RNA (mRNA)
			the mRNA forms the template for which proteins are made
		DNA to mRNA
			1. An enzyme, RNA polymerase, attaches to a specific sequence of DNA in the upstream region (5' end of DNA) of the template strand (promoter region) the double stranded DNA unzips
			2. The complementary mRNA is copied from the exposed template strad, joining free RNA nucleotides. This works in the 5' to 3' direction to make a 3' to 5' mRNA strand
			3. The RNA polymerase encounters a termination signal in the template DNA strand to unbind and stop transcription. This found after the coding region is copied.

		Post-Transcription modification
			After transcription the mRNA sequence copied is called pre-mRNA
			Genes contain coding regions called exons which will give the protein
			Genes also contain non-coding sections that do not contain instructions for a protein called introns
			Introns must be removed from the pre-mRNA to give a continuous mRNA template for proteins
			Alternative splicing occurs
			Caps and tails
				Before the mRNA is ready to leave the nucleus the following occurs first
					A cap made of altered guanine (methyl guanosine) is added to the 5' end. this protects the pre-mRNA from enzyme attack
						The nucleases try to break down the mRNA, which would lead to mutations, which is why the altered guanine cap is needed to protect the pre-mRNA
					A poly-adenine tail, that contains up to 250 As, are added to the 3' end. This 
					contributes to the stability of the mRNA. 
			Does not occur in prokaryotes as there is no nucleus, transcription and translation occurs at the same time

		To create protein from genetic information, a cell must undergo a series of steps. The first is transcription, where the DNA template strand is read and transcribed into pre-mRNA. However, it must be processed before translation by splicing introns and the addition of a 5â€™ methyl-G cap and a 3' poly-A tail. The mRNA can now be translated. This is possible due to its sequences of three nucleotides in the mRNA known as codons. At the ribosome, mRNA is used to create a protein.
		Sample questions
			1. What happens to pre-mRNA before it goes to the ribosome? why?
			2. The gene for insulin is triggered to be read by a hormone binding to DNA. Outline the steps of transcription to be read by a hormone binding to DNA. Outline the steps of transcription to produce a code for ribosomes to make insulin.
				RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of the insulin gene, unwinding it. RNA polymerase moves the coding template strand from 3' to 5' to create a complementary 5' to 3' RNA strand. RNA polymerase continues until it reaches a termination sequence, where it then detaches.
	Translation 
		Translation occurs at a ribosome, where the ribosome binds to the mRNA strand and reads it. The process is facilitated by tRNA molecules and their tri-nucleotide sequences known as anticodons. Amino acids delivered by tRNA molecules are linked into a polypeptide chain until a STOP codon is reached and translation is terminated.
		Triplets and codons
			Every three nitrogenous bases in DNA is a triplet
			When a copy of DNA is made with RNA, it forms a codon 
			Codons are read together by ribosomes
			Every codon is a amino acid
			A polypeptide chain of amino acids creates a protein
		Translating mRNA
			When mRNA is formed, the single strand leaves the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It encounters ribosomes, little protein factories that take the code and translate into a protein chain
			tRNA (transfer RNA) brings amino acids that complement the codon to the ribosome
			All new proteins start with the same codon (AUG) which codes for Methionine
				Stop codon is not an amino acid
				One mRNA can go through multiple ribosomes
				Read in 5' to 3'

	Protein Secretory Pathway
		Most cells create secretory proteins
		Exocytosis
			Process of releasing a large molecule out of a cell
			This will create a membrane bound vesicle
			The vesicle will fuse with the cell membrane and release its contents out into the the extracellular environment
		Pathway out of the cell
			Ribosomes involved in making proteins are primarily on the rough endoplasmic reticulum
				There are free floating ribosomes however they make proteins that are used within the cell
			Once a polypeptide has been made by the ribosome, its a long chain that is not necessarily in the correct 3D shape
			It is the job of the rough ER to fold and modify the polypeptide into the correct protein
				This could be done by adding a carbohydrate chain to make glycoprotein
				The lumen of the rough ER (hollow openings between folds) will help fold the polypeptide into the correct 3d shape

		Golgi Apparatus
			As a secretory protein makes its way out of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, it is packaged into a transport vesicle to travel into the inside the cell of the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is made of flattened folds of plasma membrane responsible for final modifications of the protein and packaging into secretory vesicles to be exocytosed out of the cell

Transcription occurs as RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of the target gene, unwinding the DNA strand. The RNA polymerase then reads the 3' to 5' template strand, creating a complementary 5' to 3' mRNA strand. This continues until it reaches a termination sequence, after which it stops. It then has its introns removed and its exons spliced. Before it leaves the nucleus for translation, it has a poly A tail and a Methyl Guanosine cap attached, protecting the mRNA from enzymes. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and goes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it binds with a ribosome. After tRNA binds with a start codon, tRNA then binds with the RNA's codon due to its complementary anti-codon, creating a polypeptide chain of amino acids. This process continues until the ribosome reaches a stop codon, creating a protein.
