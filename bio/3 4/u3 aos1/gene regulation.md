Gene regulation 
	Ensure cells will produce functional proteins for that cell type
	Structural genes
		Genes that are expressed continuously
		Genes that encode proteins that are required constantly in cells are express continuously
		These genes are required for basic function of the cell
			Energy provision, transport proteins in the membrane, repair and maintenance of organelles and cell division
	Regulator genes
		Other genes are regulated in cells and not always expressed
		Not all genes are needed at all times
			Helps somatic cells specialise in function\
	Unregulated gene regulation
		Can result in unwanted or uncontrolled expression of genes
			Such as teratomas (tumours)
Prokaryotic cells
	Prokaryotes use operons to regulate which genes are made and when
	If they need a new nutrient, they need enzymes to build it. After there a lot of tryptophan made, they need to stop producing enzymes that build tryptophan

	Operon includes
		Structural genes
			Genes that are related and used in a biochemical pathway
		Promoter 
			The nucleotide sequence that can build with RNA polymerase to start transcription. This sequence also includes a operator region
		Operator
			The nucleotide sequence that can bind with repressor protein to inhibit transcription
	RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. Separate to the operon is the regulatory gene, it has a promoter that can bind to RNA polymerase. This will become a regulatory protein, which will bind to the operator and block RNA polymerase in the operon.
	Regulatory genes and repressors
		Regulatory gene
			A gene that produces a protein called a repressor that can inhibit the transcription of an operon by attaching to the operator
			A repressor attached to an operator region will block RNA polymerase from moving along the operon to transcribe the structural genes until it reaches a terminator sequence.
	Trp Operon
		the purpose of trp operon is to synthesise the amino acid tryptophan in E. coli bacteria
		This is a repressible operon. The structural genes are active until the presence of something repress them and makes them inactive. 
		The trp operon includes 5 structural genes that make five enzymes necessary for the synthesis of tryptophan. 
		There is also a repressor protein (coded by a regulatory gene not part of the trp operon) that is inactive when there is no tryptophan present!![[trp operon.png]]
		When enough tryptophan is made for the cell the repressor protein binds to tryptophan and becomes active
		Tryptophan acts as a co-repressor
		The repressor protein is now the correct shape to the bind to the operator region to repress the trp operon
		The bound repressor prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes required to build tryptophan![[trp operon with regulatory protein.png]]
		Attenuation
			In prokaryotes like E. coli, the processes of transcription and translation occur concurrently
			This means that as mRNA is made, a ribosome is translating the mRNA as it is being made to make a polypeptide
			There is an untranslated region after the operator and before the structural genes that make key enzymes to build tryptophan called the leader region
			This leader region regulates the trp operon through a process called attenuation and controls whether or not transcription continues![[leader region.png]]
			The attenuator
				As the leader sequence is transcribed, it forms a mRNA strand that can bind to itself in hairpin structures
				This mRNA can give 3 outcomes : pause, continue or terminate transcription of the trp operon
				The 4 domains of the attenuator region can bind in different combinations based on how fast ribosomes translate the mRNA from the leader
				Part of the polypeptide chain coded by the leader requires tryptophan amino acids to be joined in sequence
				High Tryptophan levels
					The ribosome translates quickly, resulting in a tightly bound loop forming between domain 3 and 4 (attenuator)
					The loop blocks further translation of the rest of the operon (termination)
					The ribosome detaches from the short (attenuated) strand mRNA strand prematurely, stopping transcription as the structural genes are not expressed. ![[trp operon attenuator.png]]
