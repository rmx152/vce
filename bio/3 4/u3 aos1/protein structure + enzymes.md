- DNA becomes mRNA during transcription. DNA cannot leave the nucleus. mRNA goes to a ribosome bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is where translation occurs (mRNA to protein). Ribosome creates protein through the mRNA. It goes to the Golgi apparatus, moving through. The protein is then exported by a vesicle. If mRNA is not to be exported, it would go to unbound ribosomes.

    - Quaternary Structure
        - Proteins made up of multiple polypeptide chains
        - Not all proteins have quaternary structure
        - More complicated molecules

- Enzymes
    - What are enzymes
        - Enzymes are biological (**protein**) catalysts
        - Enzymes increase the rate of reactions by lowering the activation energy required to occur (catalyse reactions)
            - They do not increase the amount of product formed
        - Activation energy
            - The energy required to break the original bonds in the reactants (substrates)
                - This must be overcome for new bonds to form
        - Enzymes are not directly involved in reactions ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/pLc5ympxjvpSR3PCrqivAld0hp5z0i93EHjToD4l2NGIKYay8JlABFLuvvIKJHcRn36BeNDYjBsRJVfdS2z4YbpivYBecjX5SFhFl1B_iLyAKUx2cER0RQPdmufWlMqS.png)
    - Enzymes are specific to their substrate/s
        - Only catalyse one type of reaction
        - The active site of the enzyme is where the substrates bind
        - This specificity is due to the fact that the active site of the enzyme is complementary in shape and charge to the substrate/s
        - The active site is largely determined by the tertiary structure of the enzyme
            - The active site's shape and charge is ultimately determined by the enzyme's primary structure
        - When enzymes are bound to their substrate/s we refer to this as an enzyme substrate complex
        - A molecule that is not complementary to the active site will not be able to bind to the enzyme ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/wLF8sbqvCuRMMEL6-dYzSBo3chBRmXpadv4mplNCyVzrv-URKZ3OJiIxSIyXy3eCKOZPWBrDGTJQLuQExeC4t9usayysYv2INyzj6wkpHcoPC5WI4pRYKRRuDgeWmbbE.png)
    - Types of Enzyme specificity
        - Absolute (substrate) specificity
            - Where the enzyme can act on only one specific substrate
        - Bond specificity
            - Where the enzyme can only act on one specific bond, for example amylase (which catalyses the breakdown of starch) can only act on the 1,4 glycosidic linkages between the glucose monomers that make up the starch molecule
        - Group specificity
            - Where an enzyme can only act on molecules that have a articular functional group around a bond
    - Reactions with + without enzymes
