- Gene
    - A particular sequence of DNA bases that code for a specific polypeptide chain
        - Inherited from parent to offspring
        - Locus = fixed position on a chromosome where a specific gene is located
- Gene expression
    - The transcription and translation of a gene
        - The process in which the genetic material (DNA) is converted into a functional 3D protein

- Step 1: Transcription occurs in the nucleus, a pre-mRNA strand is formed from DNA
- Step 2: the pre-mRNA must undergo post transcriptional modification in the nucleus to become mature mRNA
- Step 3: The mRNA moves to a ribosome (either free in the cytosol or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum)
- Step 4: The mRNA is translated at the ribosome into a polypeptide chain
- Step 5: The polypeptide chain is modified, transported and secreted or used within the cell

- Transcription
    - The process of producing mRNA from a DNA templated
    - Occurs in the nucleus
        - RNA polymerase (an enzyme) binds to the promoter region of the gene to be transcribed on the template strand of DNA
        - The RNA polymerase molecule unwinds the DNA and moves along the template strand reading it in a 3' to 5' direction whilst synthesising RNA by joining ribonucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction (strands are anti parralel)
        - When RNA polymerase reaches the end of the gene (termination sequence), the pre-mRNA molecule will be released
        - The pre-mRNA strand is complementary to the template strand and has the same sequence as the coding strand (other than T being replaced by U) ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/bV7TK1dK0gbpxX9aGWUudMPX8tm2mt8t6npOiq8BNJdSAhE7sZsD37HZrrQJ6SRW44-EkKorONfifNEtBBOl6CDsoF_0D-gNDjRtNA8WIDHJ0YetkrB9rROx83KAeZtu.png)
- RNA Processing
    - Eukaryotic cells undergo three important types of post-transcriptional modifications within the nucleus
        - Introns are removed and exons are spliced together
            - Introns are non-coding regions
            - Exons are coding regions
            - Mature mRNA is shorter than pre-mRNA
        - A methyl guanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the RNA molecule
        - A poly-A tail is added to the 3' end of the RNA molecule
    - Once these modifications have taken place, the RNA molecule is mature mRNA and will leave the nucleus and move to a ribosome
    - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/lv2YOMP2wofZ_ocemAVpqGQVhssFqhi_mnRiWsR8as8YlZdwI6Sc5PfYmWi97JJeicc9ogM9GdQZ2AgVGzoeOolBoNzrTfR-RJbNS0bMSQDM9J_bGREcTW3YXI5AJWbP.png)
    - Removing introns from the molecule is important as these regions do not code for protein molecules and they will be useless in translation (these regions are important for other reasons)
        - i.e. One gene may be able to code for more than one protein (or variation of a protein) depending on which exons are kept in or left out (alternative exon splicing)
        - This may help explain what the amount of proteins the body makes are so diverse despite the amount of DNA present
    - The 5' methyl cap is important because it helps initiate the process of translation (recognition at the ribosome)
    - Both the 5' cap and the 3' poly-A-tail protect the RNA strand from damage (e.g from enzymes) and add stability
    - The 3' poly-A-tail assists in export from the nucleus

- Translation
    - Protein synthesis; the process by which a polypeptide molecule is produced from mRNA at a ribosome
        - Once is leaves the nucleus, the mRNA strand migrates to a ribosome
        - The mRNA strand will eneter the ribosome at the 5' end
        - The start codon AUG instructs for translation to begin, directing for the amino acid methionine to start the polypeptide chain
        - Each successive codon in the mRNA will pair up with the anticodon of a tRNA molecule carrying a specific amino acid within the ribosome
        - The process continues with more codons and anticodons pairing, resulting in the amino acids being carried by the tRNA molecules being added to the growing polypeptide chain via peptide bonding (condensation polymerisation)
        - Once a stop codon (UUA, UAG, or UGA which doesn't code for an amino acid) is reached, translation will cease and the polypeptide chain will be released
    - Translation occurs at ribosomes either attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum or free floating in the cytoplasm
    - Proteins translated at the RER are exported for use out the cell
    - Proteins translated at free floating ribosomes remain within the cell
- Gene Regulation
    - Gene structure
        - Introns - non-coding sections of a gene
        - Exons - sections of the gene that form mRNA + code for proteins
        - Promoter region - section of gene that RNA polymerase binds to
        - Operator regions are found in prokaryotic operons but not eukaryotic genes
        - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/KMdsb6m5n8x1ToYFja9Vv6wVmar2LJ96D53YAIHdTH2inUSV8bs5WCMoeA7CCEhZN9MG88K2Uzdx83YAh9trO4SNhlZOUDBdaTGwpzYFSQnSUOvrKciqz3g3d96YkMkk.png)
    - Every cell has the same genome, however they can regulate the production of certain proteins based on the cell's specific needs
        - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/9uZ3SnJKE1WLwEEjMSN6yhlsVDvSybiyLv8PvF_LgiZ38BjlOX2MGZH2yGM8CFc7lNDBnt2kjDwDW89AshG41VPJWq7gX7bRdTyshwN5HW_7I1r1OwWDn-L3hXxHUwu-.png)
    - Transcription factors
        - DNA binding proteins that bind to specific sequences of DNA (ie. the promoter region) and regulate gene expression by either increasing or decreasing transcription of a gene
            - Transcription factors called repressors can prevent transcription by binding to the promoter region or operator region of DNA, thereby preventing RNA polymerase from binding and transcribing the DNA
            - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/R6zWov-BodkpiCrP49rD0ChZo2aG9dLbNCi3FGZTIeJVsuw3-Pr0ryFjU0MUACldmrTJFAhG-A17mTaNtUNz2Ds-IWZcNP3E2g5pn0CGgGiF79m5OxgNXARH5UPzeeYt.png)
    - Regulatory genes
        - Genes that code for the production of proteins (such as transcription factors) that regulate gene expression
    - Structural genes
        - Genes that produce a protein or product that forms part of the structure or the function of an organism (every gene except regulatory genes)
    - Signalling molecules (e.g hormones)
        - Bind to receptors on/within a cell can influence gene expression in that cell
            - Can activate transcription factors that assit in RNA polymerase bidning
            - Can inactivate transcription factors that prevent RNA polymerase binding
            - Can inhibit a particular gene
            - Hormones can also bind to DNA directly to alter gene expression
    - Gene expression is influence by the cell type, stage of development, and the external + internal environment of the cell
    - Different cells can produce different protein products despite containing the same DNA
    - Genes are only expressed when the product it needed so it can save energy and resources
    - Producing excess proteins, or proteins when they are not needed, could harm the organism
    - Some genes are only required to be expressed at certain points in the lifespan (e.g. in embryonic development)
    - Some genes need to be expressed in all cells at all times
        - Referred to as housekeeping genes
    - Operon
        - A segment of DNA containing a group of genes that are transcribed together (prokaryote only)
            - Separate from the promoter (where RNA polymerase binds)
    - trp operon is a prokaryotic example of gene expression regulation
        - There is a gene in some bacteria, including E. coli, that codes for the production of the protein tryptophan (trp)
        - When too much tryptophan is present, the tryptophan binds to a repressor (type of transcription factor), causing it to bind to the operator region of the gene – this stops transcription from occurring by preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter region
        - When there is little/no tryptophan, this means that tryptophan doesn’t bind to the repressor, causing the repressor to change in conformation. The repressor then detaches from the operator region allowing transcription to occur (as RNA polymerase can then bind to the promoter of the operon)
            - The repressor is coded for by a regulatory gene (trpR) that sits upstream of the tryptophan-producing gene on the operon
        - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/yfCfbihKl33FV9iRxRmVU5c2TCRjATETKJ-Eqq61FMx0UIFPZHdrjOCDQp67gVvVy3XmEP79lLPU3r7NCT8RFS9121sLhW8CtY6PY6uMZt3Dkepc4IoH_deT6aQNpaNr.png)
        - A second method of gene regulation in the trp operon is attenuation
            - While repressors prevent transcription from starting, attenuation prevents transcription from completing
            - A region called the leader codes for an attenuator sequence
                - The attenuator sequence forms hairpin structures
            - Within the leader are two tryptophan codons
            - This means to translate the leader it needs tryptophan![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/nkteRo3iJWoRJiWztky4Qp__PTmnUxGpeakMkWfOVcKnDmwn_lOWjptXi_VbhH1EL5HHyH8Ymj9QsA5JNbc1l1EaPYE0JYKbIYurBIHNN3DzpXjovKFMsYgLba3E8g1n.png)
            - Low trytophan Levels
                - The ribosome moves through the leader slowly as the tryptophan is needed for translation
                - A hairpin structure is created that does not stop transcription
            - High tryptophan levels
                - The ribosome moves through the leader quickly as there are a lot of tryptophan to translate the sequence
                - A hairpin structure is created that does stop transcription
                - The ribosome falls off the mRNA and the RNA polymerase detaches from the operon
            - Attenuation is possible because transcription and translation occur at the same place, this is not possible in eukaryotes because translation occurs in the cytoplasm while transcription occurs in the nucleus.
                - As RNA polymerase moves through the operon, the ribosome can begin translating the mRNA, even though the full strand isn't completed yet
