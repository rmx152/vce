Emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases
	Infectious diseases
		Every year, around five new diseases emerge in human beings due to factors such as environmental change, population growth and urbanisation. 
	Emerging diseases are defined as:
		a disease caused by a newly identified or previously unknown agent
		a disease that has existed but whose incidence in humans has increased in the past two decades, either locally or internationally.
	A re-emerging disease is a disease which reappears after a significant decline in its incidence. Re-emerging diseases were once controlled but have increased to a level that causes significant health issues.
	In many cases, the disruption of ecosystems by humans and increased travel has increased our exposure to new or re-emerging disease-causing agents
	Factors that increase the risk of disease emergence/re-emergence
		Mutations and evolution in pathogens
		Globalisation and increased mobility of humans
		Exposure of humans to animals
		Increased population size and population density
		Decreasing vaccination rates
	Mutations and evolution of pathogens
		Every time a pathogen replicates, it copies DNA and is susceptible to mutations
		Furthermore, pathogens that successfully survive in hosts have favourable adaptations that have been selected for via evolution
		As generations of the pathogen replicate within their hosts, there can be gradual changes to proteins that help the pathogen become more virulent (ability to be infectious and cause harm) or change their surface antigens to evade the immune system
		All pathogens can mutate and evolve, making previous defences ineffective
	Pandemic vs Epidemic
		As the world is now so much more connected, pathogenic agents that in the past may have been isolated to only one region can more easily spread across multiple countries and regions. These can then develop into epidemics and/or pandemics. 
		The terms pandemic and epidemic both relate to the uncontrolled spread of infectious diseases, but they differ in geographic spread. A pandemic affects a much larger geographical area compared with an epidemic. In an interconnected world, an epidemic can develop into a pandemic (but not vice versa).
		For the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an event as a pandemic, the infection must spread easily and sustainably among human populations in at least three countries in at least two different WHO regions.

	Population size and density
		When population size increases, there are more potential hosts to act as reservoirs for a pathogen and to spread the disease further
		Furthermore, human populations tend to cluster near cities where there is increased infrastructure. This results in areas with high population density as more people live together in a smaller area
		These conditions are rife for contagious diseases to spread quickly 
			crowded areas have a higher rate of disease spread compared to less densely populated areas
		As the world rapidly urbanises, there is the potential for more epidemics to develop and spread

	Exposure to animals
		As humans diminish biodiversity by cutting down forests and building more infrastructure, they’re increasing the risk of pandemics
		While some animal species are going extinct, those that tend to survive and thrive — rats and bats, for instance — are more likely to host potentially dangerous pathogens that can make the jump to humans.
		When a disease ‘jumps’ from an animal host to human host, this is known as zoonosis 
			the pathogen needs to mutate to be able to survive transmission and to infect human host cells

The impact of European arrival on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
	British colonisation in Australia led to the dramatic decline in populations of Australian Aboriginal peoples. 
	One of the main reasons for this significant decrease was the introduction of new diseases to these populations to which they had no prior exposure.

	Despite only a small number of individuals being in the First Fleet (around 1500 in total), they brought in various new diseases and pathogens. Prior to this invasion and the passage through the Torres Strait, there was no evidence of these diseases in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations.
	The major epidemic diseases brought to Australia during the early contact stage include:
		Smallpox
		Chickenpox 
		Syphilis
		Tuberculosis
		Influenza 
		Measles 
	The introduction of the source of virulent microbes and viruses through European colonisation launched new exotic diseases in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. 
	Because these peoples had never been exposed to most of the new infectious pathogens, there were large numbers of susceptible individuals and low herd immunity, resulting in the spread of new infectious diseases and significant fatalities.
	Factors increasing the impact of European diseases in Australia
		No previous exposure to or knowledge of pathogens
		Population density of groups forced into camps by colonisers 
		Decreased health and nutritional status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples due to disruption by colonisation
		Intergroup social relationships
Controlling the spread of disease
	Identify the pathogen
		Visualising the pathogen using microscopes to determine their physical structure
		Testing phenotypic traits of the pathogen, such as what conditions they can grow in or responses to biochemical tests, to determine the genus and species of the pathogen
		Running immunological tests to determine the antigens present on the pathogen
		Molecular tests to sequence genetic material of the pathogen
	Understanding modes of transmission
		Infectious diseases are diseases caused by pathogens however not all infectious diseases are contagious
		Contagious refers to infectious diseases that are spread from one person to another (human to human). Most pathogens require a host to survive or to continue their life cycle, so they may use one or more different modes of transmission to enter a host body
		Modes of transmission vary for infectious diseases, such as:
			Animal vectors
			Airborne transmission
			Droplet transmission
			Direct physical contact transmission
			Indirect physical contact transmission
			Faecal-oral transmission

		How contagious is the disease?
			R0, pronounced “R naught,” is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. It’s also referred to as the reproduction number. As an infection is transmitted to new people, it reproduces itself.
			R0 tells you the average number of people who will contract a contagious disease from one person with that disease. It specifically applies to a population of people who were previously free of infection and haven’t been vaccinated.
			![[pathogen emergence and control-20240529110346623.webp]]
			R0  values greater than 3 are likely to outbreak or result in epidemics
			Seasonal influenza has an R0 of 0.9-2.1 whilst COVID-19 has a median R0 of 5.7
			Measles has the highest known R0 to man, with an R0 of 18 
			These values help scientists to determine how fast a disease spreads and how much of the population would need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity levels
			The spread of a disease is especially evident when scaled up to many rounds of infection

	Controlling disease transmission
		Scientific strategies
			act to reduce or stop transmission of and infection by a particular pathogen and to potentially develop treatments to control or eliminate the pathogen. These treatments may include (but are not limited to) vaccines, antibiotics, antivirals and fungicides. 
			Antibiotics
				Targeted chemical signals that disrupt the normal function of bacteria
				Is considered a form of chemotherapy as chemicals are used to treat a disease 
					they are often derived from naturally occurring compounds
				Lots of different effects and our research into new antibiotics is giving us more ways to stop bacterial growth and infection
				![[pathogen emergence and control-20240529110936555.webp]]
				Broad v Narrow spectrum
					Broad spectrum antibiotics (for example tetracycline) are effective against a wide range of bacteria
						useful when doctors are unsure of what is causing the infection. 
					Narrow spectrum antibiotics are targeted and work on a small range of bacteria
						used when the bacteria is known
				Antibacterial resistance
					Bacteria are capable of rapid growth and fast evolution
					The use of antibiotics for non-bacterial infections or for less than the prescribed course of antibiotics is seeing the increase of resistance from bacteria
					Super-bacteria are emerging who are resistant to available antibiotics (for example: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA)
			Antivirals
				Treatments for viral infections are very complex due to viruses evolving to evade treatment options
				Antiviral drugs can work in different ways, but they are typically the most effective when the virus is replicating in a cell
				Different modes of action include:
					 Blocking fusion/entry of a virus to the host cell by binding to surface receptors on the host cell
					Blocking uncoating of the virus by inhibiting the action of viral membrane proteins
					Block viral protease enzymes
					Interfere with the assembly of new virions
					Block DNA replication by interfering with reverse transcriptase or viral DNA polymerase
					Block the release of new virions from host cells
					Block integration of viral DNA into the host genome
					Stimulate the immune system
				Relenza
					Relenza is an antiviral drug against influenza 
					It is a neuraminidase inhibitor that binds to the neuraminidase on the surface of influenza virus particles 
					Neuraminidase cleaves the budding virus from the host cell membrane, hence Relenza inhibits the new viral particles' ability to escape from the infected cell
						The drug is a competitive inhibitor of the neuraminidase enzyme
					The influenza virus is restricted to a smaller number of cells and the body's immune system has a better chance of killing the virus. 
					Taken within 48 hours of flu symptoms

			Fungicides
				Antifungal medications are often used topically (applied directly on the body) to treat infectious diseases caused by the growth of fungi
				These infections typically affect skin, hair and nails. Some fungi can grow inside the body (such as Aspergillosis that affects the lungs or fungal meningitis that affects the brain)
				Antifungals work by either killing the fungus or by preventing their growth
				Antifungals can be sprays, creams, gels, tablets or injections
		Social strategies
			strategies that support the scientific effort to reduce and control the spread of a pathogen in a population, and to ensure that the scientific strategies are effectively implemented
			There are a wide variety of social strategies and depending on the disease, a combination of different strategies may be implemented. These include:
				Enforced quarantines
				Public education on methods to limit the spread of the disease (hygiene and preventative methods to reduce risk of infection) or on proper use of medications (to avoid antibiotic resistance)
				Government mandates (restrictions of public density limits and distancing, mask use)
				Funding for research, testing, contact tracing and vaccination programs
			Social strategies work to help increase the effectiveness of scientific strategies as necessary scientific strategies are reliant on public understanding and compliance
Practice question
	The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year. Why is a yearly vaccination required for influenza if vaccines provide long term immunological memory against a pathogen? (3 marks)
		Vaccines produce memory B cells against a specific antigen of a particular pathogen. The flu vaccine would provide immunity against the antigens of the influenza strains in the vaccine. (1 mark)
		However, as influenza is a virus it is susceptible to mutations due to its very quick reproduction rate in host bodies, which can change the shape of their surface antigens (1 mark)
		This means that if a person encounters this new strain of influenza, the memory B cells and antibodies that they have against influenza will not recognize this new antigen to trigger a secondary adaptive response and a new vaccine is required (1 mark)
	In 2009, there was an influenza pandemic that caused concern around the world as it was similar to Spanish flu virus of 1918. Each of these pandemics resulted from a major change in the influenza virus. What is the difference between a pandemic and an epidemic? (2 marks)
		An epidemic is an outbreak of a disease in a localised area or population (1 mark). 
		If an epidemic spreads widely, it can become pandemic. A pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area, affecting at least three countries in two different regions (1 mark).
