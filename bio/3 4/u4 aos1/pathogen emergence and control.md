Emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases
	Infectious diseases
		Every year, around five new diseases emerge in human beings due to factors such as environmental change, population growth and urbanisation. 
	Emerging diseases are defined as:
		a disease caused by a newly identified or previously unknown agent
		a disease that has existed but whose incidence in humans has increased in the past two decades, either locally or internationally.
	A re-emerging disease is a disease which reappears after a significant decline in its incidence. Re-emerging diseases were once controlled but have increased to a level that causes significant health issues.
	In many cases, the disruption of ecosystems by humans and increased travel has increased our exposure to new or re-emerging disease-causing agents
	Factors that increase the risk of disease emergence/re-emergence
		Mutations and evolution in pathogens
		Globalisation and increased mobility of humans
		Exposure of humans to animals
		Increased population size and population density
		Decreasing vaccination rates
	Mutations and evolution of pathogens
		Every time a pathogen replicates, it copies DNA and is susceptible to mutations
		Furthermore, pathogens that successfully survive in hosts have favourable adaptations that have been selected for via evolution
		As generations of the pathogen replicate within their hosts, there can be gradual changes to proteins that help the pathogen become more virulent (ability to be infectious and cause harm) or change their surface antigens to evade the immune system
		All pathogens can mutate and evolve, making previous defences ineffective
	Pandemic vs Epidemic
		As the world is now so much more connected, pathogenic agents that in the past may have been isolated to only one region can more easily spread across multiple countries and regions. These can then develop into epidemics and/or pandemics. 
		The terms pandemic and epidemic both relate to the uncontrolled spread of infectious diseases, but they differ in geographic spread. A pandemic affects a much larger geographical area compared with an epidemic. In an interconnected world, an epidemic can develop into a pandemic (but not vice versa).
		For the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an event as a pandemic, the infection must spread easily and sustainably among human populations in at least three countries in at least two different WHO regions.

	Population size and density
		When population size increases, there are more potential hosts to act as reservoirs for a pathogen and to spread the disease further
		Furthermore, human populations tend to cluster near cities where there is increased infrastructure. This results in areas with high population density as more people live together in a smaller area
		These conditions are rife for contagious diseases to spread quickly 
			crowded areas have a higher rate of disease spread compared to less densely populated areas
		As the world rapidly urbanises, there is the potential for more epidemics to develop and spread

	Exposure to animals
		As humans diminish biodiversity by cutting down forests and building more infrastructure, they’re increasing the risk of pandemics
		While some animal species are going extinct, those that tend to survive and thrive — rats and bats, for instance — are more likely to host potentially dangerous pathogens that can make the jump to humans.
		When a disease ‘jumps’ from an animal host to human host, this is known as zoonosis 
			the pathogen needs to mutate to be able to survive transmission and to infect human host cells

The impact of European arrival on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
	British colonisation in Australia led to the dramatic decline in populations of Australian Aboriginal peoples. 
	One of the main reasons for this significant decrease was the introduction of new diseases to these populations to which they had no prior exposure.

	Despite only a small number of individuals being in the First Fleet (around 1500 in total), they brought in various new diseases and pathogens. Prior to this invasion and the passage through the Torres Strait, there was no evidence of these diseases in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations.
	The major epidemic diseases brought to Australia during the early contact stage include:
		Smallpox
		Chickenpox 
		Syphilis
		Tuberculosis
		Influenza 
		Measles 
	The introduction of the source of virulent microbes and viruses through European colonisation launched new exotic diseases in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. 
	Because these peoples had never been exposed to most of the new infectious pathogens, there were large numbers of susceptible individuals and low herd immunity, resulting in the spread of new infectious diseases and significant fatalities.
	Factors increasing the impact of European diseases in Australia
		No previous exposure to or knowledge of pathogens
		Population density of groups forced into camps by colonisers 
		Decreased health and nutritional status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples due to disruption by colonisation
		Intergroup social relationships
Controlling the spread of disease
	
Practice question
	The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year. Why is a yearly vaccination required for influenza if vaccines provide long term immunological memory against a pathogen? (3 marks)
		Vaccines produce memory B cells against a specific antigen of a particular pathogen. The flu vaccine would provide immunity against the antigens of the influenza strains in the vaccine. (1 mark)
		However, as influenza is a virus it is susceptible to mutations due to its very quick reproduction rate in host bodies, which can change the shape of their surface antigens (1 mark)
		This means that if a person encounters this new strain of influenza, the memory B cells and antibodies that they have against influenza will not recognize this new antigen to trigger a secondary adaptive response and a new vaccine is required (1 mark)
	In 2009, there was an influenza pandemic that caused concern around the world as it was similar to Spanish flu virus of 1918. Each of these pandemics resulted from a major change in the influenza virus. What is the difference between a pandemic and an epidemic? (2 marks)
		An epidemic is an outbreak of a disease in a localised area or population (1 mark). 
		If an epidemic spreads widely, it can become pandemic. A pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area, affecting at least three countries in two different regions (1 mark).
