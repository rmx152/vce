Acquired immunity
	Immunity from a disease obtained from the development of antibodies against the antigen
	Formed in response to:
		Exposure to the an antigen (long term) and formation of memory cells 
			active immunity
		Transmission of antibodies (short term) with no memory
			 passive immunity
	Active immunity
		Surviving an infection by bacteria or viruses results in a naturally-acquired active immunity 
			for example chicken pox as a child makes you unlikely to get it again as an adult
		We can induce artificially-acquired active immunity by using weakened versions of pathogens (attenuated), versions that cannot replicate (inactivated) or isolating toxins or antigens from a virus or bacterium 
		Exposes the body to the pathogen and allows the body to produce antibodies and memory cells against the infection. Future infections will be dealt with quickly with the memory cell army

		 Vaccines
			Attenuated
				Live + weak pathogen
				Strong response
			Inactive
				Killed pathogen
				Medium response
			Subunit
				Antigen only
				Weak response
			mRNA
				Weak response
			Immunisation booster shots
				For some vaccines, the immunity against a particular antigen can wear off over time ðŸ¡ª especially seen in killed virus or bacteria vaccines compared to live attenuated vaccines 
				In this case, a periodic booster shot is given to strengthen and lengthen the duration of immunity

		Herd immunity
			Some people are unable to be vaccinated, due to religious beliefs, age, allergies to the vaccine, or weakened immune systems (immunocompromised)
			They rely on the majority of those around them being immunised to prevent the spread of disease and the resultant risk of infection ðŸ¡ª Herd immunity
			With COVID-19, communities with lower vaccination rates had higher case numbers and spread of COVID which put the medically vulnerable more at risk

		Mutations of a pathogen and new vaccines
			If the target antigen of a pathogen mutates over time, previous defences against that antigen become less effective (or may be completely ineffective) and a new vaccine and immune response must be launched against the new strain
			Influenza, for example, mutates quickly and new flu vaccines are developed every year that target novel (new) antigens on the virus
			The reproduction rate of a pathogen in a host affects its rate of mutation. Pathogens that replicate quickly are more likely to develop random mutations that may change their antigen shapes, resulting in the quick evolution of the pathogen

	Passive immunity
		Sometimes there is not enough time for an artificial active immunity to be acquired
		For example if a person is already infected with the pathogen or has been bitten or stung by a venomous animal
		In these cases, it is possible to administer an antibody serum (or antitoxin) against the antigen 
			artificially-acquired passive immunity
		These antibody serums are harvested from animals (monoclonal antibodies)
		Antibodies quickly bind to the antigen and is destroyed by the immune system 
			no memory formed of the infection
		Referred to as passive immunity as the antibodies against the antigen are not produced by the bodyâ€™s own immune system 
			 short term defence only
		Monoclonal antibodies
			Can be used to target cancer by creating antibodies that bind to the receptors on cancer cells
			This can tag the cell for destruction or deliver cytotoxins to the cancer cells as part of highly targeted chemotherapy
			Downsides are that the monoclonal antibodies can be recognised as foreign by immune cells
			Combat this by fusing them with human myeloma cells that makes a chimera (combines constant regions from human antibodies and variable regions of mouse antibodies)

		Naturally-acquired passive immunity
			Occurs during pregnancy and during breast feeding
			Antibodies from the mother are passed on through the placenta or in breast milk to the baby, giving it passive protection as its own immune system develops
				 immunoglobulin G or IgG (IgA is also often found)
			No memory of these antibodies after this time as the proteins from the antibodies degrade and are no made naturally by the babyâ€™s own immune cells
