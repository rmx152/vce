Immunotherapy
	Immunotherapy = modifying the immune response by medical intervention
	Immunotherapies have emerged as an effective way to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases
	Scientists are very hopeful about these new treatments, which use the body's own defence system to shut down cancer or to suppress unwanted immune responses against self cells.
	Immunotherapies generally fall under two classes depending on what the target outcome is:
	Suppression immunotherapy 
		useful for autoimmune diseases
	Activation immunotherapy 
		useful for cancer treatment
	Immunotherapy has fewer side effects than most cancer treatments because it specifically targets the immune system and not any other cells.
	Antibody therapy
		Antibody therapy involves the production of specific antibodies that boost the immune response
		These lab made antibodies can stimulate immune cells to enhance their action 
			For example, antibodies can be made that bind to cells that typically evade the immune system such as cancer cells. This helps the cell attract phagocytes.
			Similarly, antibodies can be injected to stimulate the activation of the complement protein system
		The source of antibodies for antibody therapy is typically monoclonal antibodies
		Monoclonal antibodies
			Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies artificially derived from a single B cell clone (i.e. identical specific antibodies). They are most commonly made by
				An animal (typically a mouse) is injected with an antigen and produces antigen-specific plasma cells
				The plasma cells are removed and fused (hybridised) with tumour cells capable of endless divisions (immortal cell line)
				The resulting hybridoma cell is capable of synthesising large quantities of monoclonal antibody
			Monoclonal antibodies can be used for both the therapeutic treatment and clinical detection of disease
				An example of therapeutic use involves the use of antibodies as an antibody serum
				An example of diagnostic use involves the use of antibodies in the detection of a pathogen by immunoassay (like rapid antigen tests)
			Functions of monoclonal
				Drug delivery 
				Identifying cancer cells
				Growth blocker
				Apoptosis inducer

	 Immune checkpoint inhibitors
		 Immune checkpoints are a normal part of the immune system. 
		Their role is to prevent an immune response from being so strong that it destroys healthy cells in the body.
		Immune checkpoints engage when proteins on the surface of T cells recognize and bind to partner proteins on other cells, such as some tumour cells 
			These proteins are called immune checkpoint proteins. 
		When the checkpoint (PD1) and partner proteins (PDL1) bind together, they send an “off” signal to the T cells. This can prevent the immune system from destroying the cancer.
		Immunotherapy drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors work by using monoclonal antibodies to block checkpoint proteins from binding with their partner proteins 
			This prevents the “off” signal from being sent, allowing the T cells to kill cancer cells.

		Suppression immunotherapies can be used to inhibit the action of immune cells that are attacking self tissue in the body
		They can act in lots of different ways, such as:
			Blocking the binding of immune cells to self tissue that is being attacked
			Blocking the entry of immune cells into affected areas of the body
			Interference with the release and action of cytokines that stimulate immune responses
		Taking immunosuppressant medication may leave the body vulnerable to infectious diseases and cancers
