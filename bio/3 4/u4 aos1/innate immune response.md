Types of immunity
	Natural/innate
		Non specific responses
			 react in the same way to all infections
			involves many physical and chemical barriers to infection
			have no ‘memory’ of prior infections
			level of response same for each infection of the same organism
	Acquired/adaptive
		Specific responses
			 react in a specific way to each infection
			involves the production of specialised cells and chemical substances known as antibodies 
			have a ‘memory’ of prior infections
			much greater response on a second infection by the same organism

First line of defence
	Physical barriers
		Intact skin
			Physical barrier to prevent pathogen entry
			Innate defence system
	Chemical barriers
		![[innate immune response-20240508110341857.webp]]
	Microbiota barriers
		Do not cause disease
		Those that cause no harm and do not benefit the body are called commensals 
		Those from which we benefit live in our bodies in a mutualistic relationships 
		Natural microflora can cause issues when they enter areas that do not normally have that microorganism
		Microorganisms may not ordinarily cause disease, but can turn pathogenic if they are given new circumstances to exploit 
			called opportunistic pathogens
	Repairing a breach
		![http://www.totallyu.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Skin_Cross_Section1.jpg](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rLCTjk2tqIc5uUAocuVubhp5IoT9dCf1QFPuXJ-q6IpenxvC6DMMPw8JvWDkrwUlFuAgdwW9irmB-ffivVkRoZcHlLczj3nL1UJAng7bsWTxvCkFdsbKfhrjjhcukk3t8bGLYULv8ZGH6RG-kIBBCA=s2048)			
		Damage to the deeper dermis layer of skin activates quick repair
		Results in vasoconstriction  
			blood vessels leading to the wound tighten to reduce the flow of blood to the injured area.
		Platelets (triggered by enzymes leaked from the torn blood vessel) rush to the area
		Blood cells clump to each other and then adhere to the sides of the torn blood vessel, making a plug.		
		Clotting proteins in the blood join forces to form a fibrin net that holds the platelet plug in place over the tear, and in just a few seconds or minutes (depending on how bad the scrape is), bleeding stops due to coagulation
		The fibrin plug becomes a scab that will eventually fall off or be reabsorbed into the body once healing is complete.
	Plants
		![[innate immune response-20240508112743130.webp]]
		Idioblasts
			specialised functions to defend the plant
			Sclereid (or stone) cells
				wear down the teeth of the insects feeding on them. Found on the outer skin of pears
			Crystalliferous cells
				contain calcium oxalate crystals. When a feeding insect bites into these cells, it feel like they are biting broken glass and mouthparts are torn apart
			Stinging cells 
				are shaped like needles and inject toxins into potential invaders
Second line of defence
	Consists of cells and chemicals that fight pathogens
	Non-specific
	Includes the action of phagocytes, granulocytes, inflammation and chemicals that are activated to help the immune response
	![http://www2.bakersfieldcollege.edu/bio16/images/15-01_Defense_1.jpg](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FbIhkR4XGL1_giu0Gs-qXxOcbaPvE2NzILueANYi--y6WPGgulQE3Q9KXGelNUyp38AbMQLExRd3UicJJVNgVHBVZkcoya3pdJuz0og-VzIUy03lfnT0udNh5L77PSwwVLOBOk3WgK5_bnzqBSG2Yg=s2048)![[innate immune response-20240509135128711.webp]]
	Leukocytes
		White blood cells of the second line of defence are known as leukocytes
			natural killer cells are an exception
		Functions of leukocytes
			Phagocytes
				at foreign material, cellular debris or the remnants of dead cells (apoptotic bodies)
			Granulocytes
				Release chemicals and enzymes from pre-prepared sacs called granules
			Antigen presentation
				Taking fragments of a pathogen or target cell to activate the third line of defence
		Phagocytes
			Type of white blood cell that moves to the point of entry of the pathogen
			Engulf the pathogen by phagocytosis and use intra-cellular digestion to destroy it
			Includes neutrophils (first responders) and monocytes (larger WBCs that become macrophages once they leave the bloodstream)
		Granulocytes
			Large amount of granules (vesicles) that contain enzymes and chemicals to fight pathogen
			These cells release stored granules via exocytosis
		Neutrophils
			Most abundant white blood cells
			Quick response 				
			Acts as a phagocyte and granulocyte
			Contains lots of oxidative enzymes to kill the invader
			Releases cytokines to signal for backup.
		Eosinophil				
			a granulocyte that secretes enzymes that produce holes in invading pathogens, especially large ones like parasites
		Mast cells
			a granulocyte that secretes histamine for inflammation 
		Macrophages
			 a big phagocyte that eats invaders and cleans up the site of action
			 Move to the area as permeability of the blood vessels increase
			 The immature form of macrophages that is present inside the bloodstream is a monocyte
			Macrophages also act as an antigen presenting cell
		Dendritic cell
			 antigen presenting cell that has distinct long membrane extensions to help reach out, phagocytose, and present antigens to activate the third line of defence
			 type of phagocyte
	Antigen presenting cells (APCs) process foreign materials that passes through the first line of defence and presents them to the third line of defence
	APCs contain both MHC 1 and MHC 2.
		They first check all cells and pathogens to see if their MHC 1 matches the MHC 1 seen on the APC (checking for self) or if there are any foreign antigens
		If a cell does not pass this check, the APC will engulf and rip the non-self antigen off to present on their MHC 2 to lymphocytes like T cells
	Natural killer cells
		They are granular but are classed as lymphocytes
		NK cells are innate as they do not target specific antigens on cells
		Instead, they attack cells that have fewer MHC 1 showing on their surface (downregulated MHC 1)
			This is a common mechanism for viruses and early cancer cells to avoid detection. 
			MHC 1 acts as an inhibitor to NK cells
		NK cells will detect infected cells, create holes in their membrane (releases a protein called perforin) and releases enzymes that program cells to die (granzymes)

	Cytokines
		a chemical signal (typically protein) that communicates between cells and the immune system
			Typically alert cells of an infection, directs cells to where they need to go or (most importantly) activates cells of the immune system
		In the case of a viral infection, a host cell can release a type of cytokine known as interferon to warn nearby cells of the infection
		The interferon will diffuse and bind to the receptors on nearby cells
		The nearby cells will transduce the signal resulting in a response from these cells to guard themselves against the impending viral infection:
		For example, cells can produce anti-viral proteins, trigger a fever or inflammation, activate immune cells
	Inflammation
		Inflammation is a reaction to infection
		Arterioles in the area of a cut or infection (blood vessels carrying oxygenated blood) dilate (increased blood supply) 
		Swelling occurs 
		Histamine increase the permeability of blood vessels and attracts more and more phagocytes to the infection 
			monocytes in the bloodstream enter the tissue fluid of an infected area to become macrophages
			Antihistamines act as competitive inhibitors to prevent inflammation from occuring
		Interleukins (a subgroup of cytokines) are released by macrophages to send the signal to the hypothalamus to induce a fever

		Sample answer
			![[innate immune response-20240509141028079.webp]]
	Pus
		Once the phagocytes fighting an infection have engulfed all that they can, they often die
			These dead white blood cells accumulate as pus
		Pus forms in the area of inflammation 
			contains cell debris as well as some living WBCs
		Eventually reabsorbed by the body or released from the skin
	Complement proteins
		Phagocytes are helped by a series of complement proteins  
			there are about 20 different complement proteins
		The activation of one kind of complement protein results in a cascade effect where each activated complement protein activates another
		stimulate other phagocytes to become more active
		chemotaxis
			complement proteins attract phagocytes to the site of infection 
		opsonization
			will stick to invading pathogens 
			lysis
			destroy the membranes of invading micro-organisms
