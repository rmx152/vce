Types of immunity
	Natural/innate
		Non specific responses
			 react in the same way to all infections
			involves many physical and chemical barriers to infection
			have no ‘memory’ of prior infections
			level of response same for each infection of the same organism
	Acquired/adaptive
		Specific responses
			 react in a specific way to each infection
			involves the production of specialised cells and chemical substances known as antibodies 
			have a ‘memory’ of prior infections
			much greater response on a second infection by the same organism
