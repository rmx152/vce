Pathogenicity
	Capacity to cause disease
Virulence
	How intense the effect of the pathogen in causing disease
		Different factors of the pathogen can give it its virulence (adhesion to the cell, toxins, ability to evade the host immune system etc.)
Pathogenic microorganisms
	Pathogenic microorganisms have evolved characteristics that allow them to affect or invade a cell type, or release toxins that affects a cell’s external environment
Pathogens
	Effects
		Destroy cells
		Produce toxins (poisons)
		Interfere with normal function
		Trigger an excessive immune response
	Can be cellular or non-cellular
	Many different types with different methods of infection and action
	Types of pathogens
		Viruses
		Prions
		Bacteria
		Fungi
		Protists
			Kingdom Protista
			Group of unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms 
				range from 1 micrometre in diameter (Ostreococcus tauri) to as large as 20cm in diameter (Syringammina fragilissima)
			Can reproduce sexually or asexually
			Types
				Algae-like - Photosynthesize
				Protozoa (animal-like) – Able to move
					Plasmodium (Malaria)

		Ectoparasites
			Live on the outside of the body
			Often referred to as arthropods
			Multicellular organisms
				 Examples: 
					Lice
					Ticks
					Fleas 
					Mosquitos 
			Cause minor symptoms and easily treated
			Vectors for pathogens
		Endoparasites
			Live on the inside of the body
			Multicellular organisms
			Rely on the host for nutrition and shelter
			Examples
				Roundworm/threadworm/pinworm
				Tapeworm/flatworm
				Hydatid worm/Hyper Tape-worm/ Dog Tapeworm

Self vs Non-self
	Cells have proteins on their plasma membranes that are determined by genes that give your cells an identity
	Proteins produced by these genes are called markers 
		Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
			MHC is also known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system
	All nucleated cells have MHC markers on their surfaces
	MHC proteins constantly carry bits of cellular material from the cytosol to the cell surface 
		presents this information to passing immune cells
		“snapshot” of what is going on inside cell
		give the surface of cells a unique label or “fingerprint”

	All cells with a nucleus have MHC 1 
		Red blood cells won't have MHC 1
	Some white blood cells (antigen presenting cells and B cells) also have MHC 2 in addition to MHC 1
	MHC markers produced by the DNA of an individual are called 'self'
		Class I MHC are found on all cells with a nucleus
		Class II MHC are found on macrophages and B cells
	Markers not produced within an individual are called “non-self”
	White blood cells of the immune system are checking all body cells to make sure that they carry self MHC markers

	MHC is inherited from parents 
		This is why transplants from within a family are more likely to be accepted by the body
	Antigens
		Self antigens will not cause a response by white blood cells
		Foreign antigens will cause a response from WBCs
			can be from pathogens or non-pathogens like cancer cells, transplanted tissue or pollen. MHC markers can act as an antigen (such as transplanted tissue that isn’t matched to the recipient)
		Presented by antigen-presenting cells using the MHC to give immune cells a snapshot of the internal environment of the cell 
			viral infected cells will present fragments of the virus to signal an infection
