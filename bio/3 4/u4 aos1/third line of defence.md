Third line of defence
	The lymphatic system
		Blood is a fluid that moves nutrients and oxygen around the body through a series of vessels
		The cardiovascular system in humans is a complex and closed circulatory system that pumps blood around your body
		Blood stays in your blood vessels. If you have blood surrounding your body cells directly then you have internal bleeding and have broken blood vessels 
		Types of fluid
			Blood
				The fluid transported in the blood vessels 
			Lymph
				The fluid in the lymphatic 
			Tissue fluid
				The fluid in between these two types of vessels (in between the cells)
					also known as interstitial fluid and extracellular fluid
				Tissue fluid is the liquid that surrounds the cells, allowing for transport between blood and cells (e.g. Respiratory gases)  
					 this is done through diffusion
				Tissue fluid is the result of pressure from heartbeats pushing fluid out of capillaries
				The fluid, some smaller proteins and white blood cells move through small gaps in capillaries and collect around cells 
				![http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcStoYWS-xSvXB6VFgSFHGI530JU3rbIMTbsg_CapPsN5xR1G7W2](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jlLLwPi8CH_dShWwPEmdIskVF-JPLgC3_kV-Z4z1vAxD-35mt2oxlwz_1gJPkApbqsYYq9PMaQIPe53Rg9DEucqztpxDY1Cw_GixjDfRGePGe08CuEOnAzK0ZgOIWiX6Ms3LKXHFe--B9sKM9jhCkA=s2048)
				Some of the tissue fluid will be pushed back into the capillaries. But because the pressure inside the capillaries is higher than the pressure inside the tissue, not all fluid will flow back.
				To get rid of the remaining fluid would be a waste.
		The lymphatic system is a one way system that collects excess tissue fluids and returns it to the blood stream
		Lymph capillaries are thin, blind ended vessels that are permeable to tissue fluid
		Once tissue fluid entered the lymphatic system it is called lymph ![http://biology-igcse.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/0/7/15070316/9569931_orig.png](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jPaXOSRp__8Y_8ctNglRiXurtNNWTjhiaj5m4niVlz4Jlat5K3X_tKLRojr3knkvUz85zoYBADo214OooOk-e1E_JPiM1CrYl5KVYJrsg6SeUvs5EmFOJdnEMtVjp_rL2QDtk1XGU1V2EHUlW3FmAQ=s2048)
		Lymph
			Lymph passes through the lymphatic system and drains back into the circulatory system at the subclavian veins (below the collarbone)
			Lymph contains lymphocytes (type of white blood cell) which are made in lymph nodes.
			Lymphocytes are very important to the immune system
				they kill threats to the body. Can be classed as T and B lymphocytes
		Transport through the lymphatic system
			The lymphatic system contains no pump and relies on muscle contractions and valves to move lymph around
			Lymph also moves through thicker areas of tissue called lymph nodes that filter out pathogens (micro-organisms and foreign material) before returning the fluid to the bloodstream 
			![http://www.lymphoedemasupport.com/pic/muscle.gif](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/G6etfDxWYq0h8jkKjeFSZ3CVhZjiFr8kbeJITOlYb0GtigYxU4h2LPIjOeGhJerO-SRyhNPtDaxK4h_DvIkwJ6OieNkc_DZMJoaLDSDhiaiFXOnTmkarSvGwthxn9SVvOJ304d33Dw2s5ukkmsBdjw=s2048)
		Primary Lymphoid tissue
			the thymus
			site where stem cells from bone marrow differentiate into mature thymus derived cells (T-cells)
		Secondary Lymphoid tissue
			Lymph nodes
			Secondary lymphoid tissue are other sites where lymphocytes interact with each other (T-cells interacting with B-cells) and with non-lymphoid cells (for example: a bacterium) to generate an immune response to antigens 
			![Image result for lymph node gif](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/LIM2HvOOnaJ8-DlpFV0XpNF1tEAL6ujJKQFDJeGmrs7hAPlSyoFxHisizf-e5_wewcsr0xIMF2rzP7wPuLSiGYY9YPhuBN4i7LIJYHfwD3VCT0Xr3ZJTHDQtyQw1-Gto7poVSsupeBG_jyKYFBO8rA=s2048)
		Other organs of the lymphatic system
			Bone marrow
				Soft tissue in the hollow centre of your larger, long bones
				Source of pluripotent stem cells (precursor cells that can differentiate into all the specific blood cells of the immune system)
				B cells develop here
			Spleen
				Flattened organ near the left side of your liver
				Filters blood to get rid of pathogens and dying/dead blood cells
				Becomes enlarged with some infections (splenomegaly)
		Problems with the lymphatic system
			Removal of lymph nodes from surgery or damage to lymphatic valves can cause a build up in tissue fluid
			This build up of fluid and swelling is called oedema
			Lymph nodes are also prone to swelling and infection as they regularly come into contact with pathogens
			Tonsils are lymph nodes in the throat that are prone to infection from bacteria ü°™ tonsillitis
	Cell mediated immunity
		Lymphocytes 
			B-Lymphocytes (B-Cells)
				Originate in bone marrow
				Mature in bone marrow
				Produce antibodies
				Humoral response to infection.
			T-Lymphocytes (T-Cells)
				Originate in bone marrow
				Mature in the thymus
				Release chemicals that help or attack
				Cell-mediated response to infection.
		Cell-mediated response
			T-cells have receptors on their surface that bind to the antigens presented by cells
			Recognises self from non-self
			There are different types of T-cells with different functions:
				Helper T-cells (TH cells)
				Cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells)
				Memory T-cells
				Suppressor T-cells
			Attacks intracellular threats and does not produce antibodies
			Doesn‚Äôt attack any cells that do not display the target antigen
		Immune response between 2nd and 3rd line of defence
			Once the pathogen has invaded and breached the first line, Antigen presenting cells will detect non-self antigens using their MHC I and then engulf and digest via phagocytosis
			APCS will then present fragments of the pathogen (an antigen) on their membranes with MHC II
			This combination of MHC II and the target antigen is going to be used to find and activate a specific complementary T cell
		T cell activation
			The APC will now travel to the lymph node where it will look for a complementary na√Øve T cell
			In immunity, a na√Øve cell is just one that hasn‚Äôt been activated before, There are different types of na√Øve T cells (like a na√Øve helper T cell for example) but for the sake of simplifying, we can just call these na√Øve T cells in general
			The MHC II/antigen complex has a particular shape in their epitope (the specific part of the antigen that binds to immune cells) that is complementary to a receptor on the T cell (T cell receptor)![[third line of defence-20240513090242949.webp]]
			An APC holding a particular antigen will only activate 1 complementary na√Øve T cell. This process is called clonal selection
			The na√Øve T cell that first gets activated is a na√Øve helper T cell, which will also release a cytokine to stimulate itself to trigger this now activated cell to copy itself (proliferation)
			These clones will then differentiate into more helper T and cytotoxic T cells (killer T cells) 
				Clonal expansion
		Helper T cell
			Regulatory cells that, when simulated with an antigen, produce and release cytokine molecules that control the development and function of other T-cells, B cells and phagocytes
			Activated Helper T cells can clone and differentiate into more Helper T cells that will go find a na√Øve B cell to activate
			This is the cell that links the cell-mediated (T cell) and humoral (B cell) responses
		Cytotoxic T-cells
			Effector cells. Also known as Killer T-Cells
			Takes action against intracellular threats (for example: virus infected cells) once stimulated by foreign antigens
			Tc cells attach and directly lyse (split open) or kill target cells on the basis of their antigens
			Releases perforin (to create holes in the membrane) OR/(and) granzymes (enzymes kept in sac-like granules in the cell) that will bind to target cells and trigger apoptosis (granzymes) cell lysis (perforin)![[third line of defence-20240513090500894.webp]]
			Cytotoxic T-cells directly target foreign cells with non-self MHC (this MHC acts as an antigen)
			Even though transplanted tissue is closely matched for MHC markers, Tc cells are very effective at their job and may still destroy tissue if there is any non-matched MHC
			Immunosuppressant drugs counteract Tc cells so that they cannot bind to antigens on the surface of transplanted cells and therefore kill this new tissue 
		Memory and Suppressor T cells
			Once an infection is over, suppressor T-cells (a type of regulatory cell) suppress the action of phagocytes and excess T cells
			This prevents overstimulation of the immune system
			Memory T-cells are derived from normal T-cells that have learned how to overcome an invader by ‚Äòremembering‚Äô the strategy used to defeat previous infections.
			Will rapidly expand the T-cell army once the enemy antigen is encountered again 
				memory can last more than 20 years

			Produces specific antibodies against a specific antigen
			Types of B cells

			Steps of B cell activation 
				1. Antigen bound to B cell receptor
						T helper cell binds to MHCII of naive B cell
						T helper cell releases cytokines, activating the B cell
				2. The B cell undergoes clonal expansion and differentiation into plasma B cells and memory B cells
				3. The plasma B cell release antibodies that will bind to the pathogen antigens causing agglutination, opsonisation and attracting phagocytes to destroy the pathogen. The memory B cells will stay until activated again in the future.

				Blood typing and precipitation of antibodies
					Naturally occurring antigens are present on red blood cells (people are grouped according to these antigens as having type A, B, AB or O)
					There is also a group of antigens called D antigens 
						the presence of this antigen is considered Rhesus positive and gives us positive and negative blood types (first discovered this antigen in the blood of the Rhesus monkey)
					Antibodies in blood recognised as ‚Äòself‚Äô does not stick to the blood cells and clump it together (called agglutination) 
						anti-B antibodies, anti-A antibodies
					Blood donations must be screened for blood cell antigens to prevent this clumping from occurring after a transfusion

Clonal Selection Theory and Immune Disorders
	Clonal selection Theory
		Humoral immunity relies on immature B cell with the right antibody configuration coming into contact with a foreign antigen in order to be activated and expanded into a B-cell army. 
		Antibodies have a constant region (light chains and heavy chains) and a highly variable region (antigen binding site)
		The variable portion is coded for by a small number of genes that are cut and rearranged to produce millions of different combinations
			Alternative splicing
		During embryonic development, millions of different randomly generated, tiny clones of lymphocytes (T- and B-cells) form which will only react with one antigen
		If a B-cell is stimulated by contact with the antigen, it divides and differentiates into plasma B-cells and memory B-cells. Likewise T-cells can develop into Helper T-cells and Cytotoxic T-cells
		B-cells can quickly create clones to respond to an invasion once stimulated by cytokines released from Helper T-cells
			These clones are specific for the antigen of the invader
			Conserves energy wasted on making a huge and varied B-cell army waiting in reserve for a future attack that might not even take place
			Only needed B-cells will mature and multiply
		Self reacting receptors
			Some receptors will inevitably react with ‚Äòself‚Äô antigens
			The immune system needs to build tolerance so that it doesn‚Äôt induce an active response to self antigens
				Immunological tolerance is not simply a failure to recognize an antigen; it is an active response to a particular epitope and is just as specific as an immune response
				Both B-cells and T-cells can be made tolerant, but it is more important for T-cells to become tolerant because B-cells cannot make antibodies to most antigens without the help of T-cells
					Lots of different theories on exactly how this process occurs 
			T cell selection
				As T-cells mature, recombination of gene segments creates the two chains that make up the T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR) 
				Although the receptors on a single T-cell are all alike, there is a virtually unlimited variation of receptor shapes created in the population of T-cells within the thymus
				T-cells only become activated when all parts of the epitope binds to the receptor 
				![http://course1.winona.edu/kbates/Immunology/images/figure_05_06.jpg|228](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XnB3Abd2lSLDNR1e1Iz4dveZdG2TNDVhUBxEnl0VihSApMgg4epDeozZscCqM_QH4fYW95lZtBU47YlRYvXFS2WSA1lEeiQVv9GgKvC45HWWLp1pRd44OIt_ucjvZCMXQjzJ1Lap6RYzXpm79icd0A=s2048)
			T cell tolerance
				Epitopes recognized by T-cell receptors in the thymus consist of small self antigens held by a MHC protein
				T-cells whose receptors bind these epitopes so tightly that they could attack the self cell are deleted by apoptosis. 
				The T-cells that survive this negative selection leave the thymus and migrate throughout the immune system to lymph nodes
			B cell tolerance 
				B cells are formed and mature in the bone marrow 
				Any cells that produce a receptor for antigen (BCR) that would bind self components too tightly undergo a process of receptor editing 
				They dip again into their pool of gene segments that encode the light and heavy chains of their BCR and try to make a new BCR that is not a threat (alternate splicing plays a big role here). If they fail, they commit suicide 
				Despite these mechanisms, some of the B-cells that escape out of the bone marrow continue to express self-reactive BCRs and may still be able to produce anti-self antibodies 
				B-cells with a potential for attacking self can be kept in check by the absence of the T-helper cells they need
					Because no self-reactive T-helper cells means no B-cell stimulation to expand into clones and produce antibodies
	Immune System Disorders
		Autoimmune diseases
			Self reacting cells that make through negative selection unchecked can go on to attack self cells
			The immune response they stimulate is called an autoimmune response
			Other disorders of failed negative selection include allergic response
			Multiple sclerosis (MS)
				MS is an autoimmune disease where B-cells release antibodies and macrophages attack the myelin sheath of neurons ü°™ results in loss of nerve conduction and irregular signalling
				Treatment for MS includes the use of immunosuppressant drugs such as monoclonal antibodies that bind with channels in the blood-brain barrier to prevent immune cell entry into the Central Nervous System 
		Allergies
			Exaggerated immune responses to an antigen found on substances that are generally considered harmless
			Inflammation and excessive mucus can be produced from this overreaction
			Severe inflammation, especially of airways, is potentially life-threatening
				anaphylactic shock
			Anaphylaxis is a result of very high levels of histamine causing loss of fluid from blood vessels
				Loss of fluid results in loss of blood pressure
				Sudden drop in blood pressure can lead to a heart attack
			Mast cell activation
				Upon your first exposure to an allergen antigen, APCs will activate T cells in the lymph node
					activated T helper cells will find their complementary B cell.
				B cells are activated and differentiate into plasma B cells that produce IgE (a complementary antibody to the allergen antigen).
				The IgE bind to the surface of mast cells
					 mast cells are now sensitised
				Upon your next exposure to the allergen, the allergen antigen binds to the IgE on mast cells, triggering the rapid release of large amounts of histamine 
					results in allergy symptoms

Example 
	An antigen presenting cell with the Ebola antigen on its MHC 2 will bind to the complementary T cell receptor on a naive T cell, causing cytokines to release which activates the naive T cell. The activated T cell undergoes clonal expansion and differentiation into cytotoxic, helper, memory, and suppressor T cells. Helper T cells find and activate B cells. Cytotoxic T cells travel to the area of infection of the Ebola virus and effect intracellular pathogens, binding to affected cells that display the target Ebola antigen, inducing the death of the cell via apoptosis, which is caused by released perforin or granzymes by the cytotoxic T cell.
Example
	The bacteria upon death produces an exotoxin. This triggers the humoral response as the cell mediated response can only affect intracellular threats, whereas the humoral response can effect intercellular threats. The antigen binds to a complementary B cell receptor. This naive B cell will then bind to a complementary helper T cell its MHC class 2 marker and received co-stimulation via cytokines from the helper T cell. The naive B cell is activated, undergoing clonal expansion and differentiation into plasma B and memory B cells. The plasma B cells then produce antibodies complementary to the antigen of the exotoxin. The antibodies bind to the antigen of the exotoxin, triggering neutralisation which prevents the exotoxin from affecting cells. The exotoxin is then killed via phagocytosis and opsonisation by phagocytes.
