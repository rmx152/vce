- Key Terms
    - Independent variable (IV)
        - the variable that is being manipulated by the researcher (an exposure, treatment, etc.)
    - Dependent variable (DV)
        - sometimes called the outcome variable, this is the variable that is being examined, is dependent on the independent variable
    - Controlled variables
        - variables other than the IV that are kept constant to prevent them influencing the dependant variable (become confounding if not controlled)
    - Experimental group
        - the group that is exposed to the independent variable
    - Control group
        - the group that is not exposed to the independent variable and acts as a comparison (enables the experimenter to check that it is the IV effecting the DV and not another variable)
- Validity + Reliability
    - Validity
        - are you measuring what you think you are measuring?
    - Repeatability
        - Can this measurement be repeated by the same person in the same conditions?
            - Same time, same place
    - Reproducibility
        - Can this experiment be reproduced by another group of researchers at a different time in a different setting?
            - Different time, different place
    - Large sample size/repeating the experiment are important to state
- Qualitative vs Quantitative Data

- Ethics in Experiments
    - Confidentiality/privacy: are participant’s details kept private and protected?
    - Informed consent: are participants willingly participating and understand what is expected of them in the study?
    - Justice: is the burden and benefit shared equally?
    - Respect for participants
    - Beneficence: will conducting the study benefit society in some way?
    - Can we avoid using animals in the study?
    - Is the experiment valid?
- Ethical Principles
    - Integrity
        - the honest reporting of all sources of information + communication of results
        - not lying / manipulating results or information in order to make your research look better
        - allowing your work to be criticised
    - Justice
        - fair consideration of all groups involved
        - not creating an imbalance of access between different groups of people
    - Beneficence
        - maximising benefits + minimising harm for those involved / affected by the research
    - Non-maleficence
        - avoiding causes of harm
        - sometimes causing harm in research may be unavoidable, so in that case the benefits must outweigh the risks
    - Respect
        - consideration for individuals’ welfare, liberty + autonomy, beliefs, perceptions, customs, and cultural heritage
        - protecting those affected by research, ensuring they are comfortable, valuing people, patients, animals etc.
- Approaches to Bioethics
    - Consequences-based
        - the outcome is what is considered of highest importance
        - objective is to achieve a positive outcome, with minimal negatives
    - Duty-based / Rule-based
        - the way in which individuals act is considered of highest importance
        - individuals must behave ethically, despite what the consequences / outcome may be
    - Virtues-based
        - the individual’s moral character is considered of highest importance decisions are made based on what good morals are
- Sources of Error + Limitations
    - Avoid human error and mistakes as answers

    - Random errors
        - These errors caused by external factors that are truly variable ie. Slightly different atmospheric pressure or temperature or uncertainties in measuring equipment
            - e.g. Scales with a +/- 0.01g tolerance
        - To negate random differences use large sample sizes, repeat experiments, and average results
    - Systematic errors
        - Cause consistent yet inaccurate result
            - A measuring cylinder which has been marked slightly wrong so every 10mL interval actually measures 11mL, it is consistently 10% above the stated value
- How to Answer Experimental Design Questions
    - What are the treatment and control groups? What is the quantity of these groups (e.g. 20 plants in each group, 50 mice in each group (Large groups, etc.)
    - 2. What are the dependent and independent variables in the experiment?
    - 3. What are the controlled variables? List ~3
    - 4. A sentence or two about your method, don’t need to go into specifics about equipment etc. but should explain how you’re changing your IV between groups and how you’re measuring the DV. And a quick note on what you would expect.
    - 5. Repeating experiment (and include WHY you do this -> what type of error are you minimising?)
