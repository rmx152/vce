Morphology 
	Study of the rules which govern the ways in which morphemes form words
		Words can consist of one morpheme (cat/travel)
		Or more than one morpheme (cat-s/travel(l)-er)
	Words are composed of similar meaningful units. The smallest meaningful unit can't be divided any further without severely altering the meaning
		Strange, asparagus, and cardigan cannot be broken down
	Types of morphemes
