Morphology 
	Study of the rules which govern the ways in which morphemes form words
		Words can consist of one morpheme (cat/travel)
		Or more than one morpheme (cat-s/travel(l)-er)
	Words are composed of similar meaningful units. The smallest meaningful unit can't be divided any further without severely altering the meaning
		Strange, asparagus, and cardigan cannot be broken down
	Types of morphemes
			Free morpheme
				Can stand by itself
				Does not need anything else to provide meaning
					Travel
			Bound morpheme
				It cannot occur on its own
				It needs another morpheme to make sense
					-ed
			Complex words
					More than one morpheme that consists of a stem (major component of word meaning) and one or more affixes, which are bound to the base form
						This can be referred to as content or lexical morphemes and function morphemes 
			Compound morpheme
				Both words make sense
					Doghouse
	Affixes
		Prefix
			Morpheme goes in front
		Suffix
			Morpheme goes on end
		Infix
			Morpheme goes inside the word 

Open Word classes
	Nouns
		Meaning
			Classed as 'naming words' 
				Names for things, places, people, places
			Can also be abstract concepts
				Emotions, activities, and states
					Business, joy, calculations, philosophy
		Form
			Many concrete nouns take inflections to show number (singular and plural) – this is often the –s (ies / es) morpheme. This is complicated, though: some nouns take no plural (eg. sheep) there are also some irregular nouns that add a different suffix (eg child – children) or change altogether for plurals (eg mouse – mice); possessive (often called genitive). 
			Some nouns for emotions or abstract nouns may be derived from other word classes by suffixes such as:   - ness, -(i)ty, -er, -ment, -ion.
			Many nouns also take a possessive –’s  (this may vary to agree with number eg. the boy’s (1 boy); the boys’ (more than 1 boy)
		Function and Behaviour
			Nouns can function as
				The head word
					a noun phrase may function in the clause as subject, object or complement
						Comes after the verb, describes the subject 
							e.g Om studies (a lot)
						Copular verbs
							Links a subject to a complement
					e.g The (determiner) really (adverb) good (adjective) Jayesh (head word)
					Modifiers
						A word giving more information to another word
					e.g Suzanne Cory High School
						Suzanne Cory (noun acting as a modifier) High School (noun)
				Genitive phrases
					eg. My bag
				Prepositional phrases
					eg. In the box
					eg. (In (the classroom) noun phrase) prepositional phrase
				Modify a head word
					eg. A girl's school, the bread knife, the nun who gave Maria a guitar
			Replaced by a pronoun
				A pronoun may be the Head word in a Noun Phrase. 
				Pronouns have a range of forms and inflections  
					eg. (Jane) (left) (school) could be replaced by (She) (left) (school)
		Types of nouns
			Abstract
				These refer to intangible and non-physical things, such as ideas, concepts, emotions, or qualities.
				    Examples: love, happiness, freedom, justice.
			Concrete
				These refer to tangible and physical objects that have a clear and definite existence.
				    Examples: chair, book, tree, cat.
			Common
				These are general names for people, places, or things and do not refer to any specific individual.
				    Examples: teacher, city, dog, computer.
			Proper
				These are specific names for particular individuals, places, or things and are usually capitalized.
				    Examples: Mary, Paris, Coca-Cola, Mount Everest.
		All nouns are after the/a/an
	Verbs
		Meaning
			Traditionally known as ‘doing’ words – words for actions. 
			They can also be words for states, relationships between things, sensory perceptions or cognitive processes (e.g. I am / it resembles / I hear / I believe).
		Form
			Regular verbs
				Base form
					walk
				Third person singular present tense (-s inflection)
					He walks
				Past participle
					walked
				Present participle
					walking
				If a verb ends in e, the e will be dropped in order to add the present participle inflection
					-ing, e.g. grieve grieving
				Example
					I am (Auxiliary) running : Present continuous
					I was (Auxiliary) running : Past continuous
					I had run : Past perfect
					I have run : Present perfect
			Irregular verbs
				Forms of be
					To be: Base form be; I am / he is / you are / we are / they are;  I was / he was / you were / they were. With this verb, was is the past tense form while been is the past participle.
				Verbs in English take various forms in order to show tense, voice (see Thorne p 11) and aspect (aspect is the timescale of a verb – whether it is complete or in progress). There are various ways to use the perfect aspect which uses the auxiliary have (see Thorne p11 for its usage) and the progressive aspect which uses the auxiliary be and which suggests that an action is ongoing or not complete.  
		Function
			A Verb Phrase functions as the Predicate or Verb element in a clause.
				A Verb element in a clause can stand alone, in imperatives such as ‘Go!’. 
				Usually a verb follows a subject and, if there’s an object the verb usually comes before it
				 A main clause has a finite verb.
			Types of verbs within a verb phrase
				Primary auxiliary verbs
					be / have / do (and, in more colloquial forms, get)
				Modal auxiliary verbs
					can / could / may / might / must / shall / will / would / should. These relate to the degree of ability / likelihood / intention / necessity or obligation / possibility
					Used to indicate how definite something may happen
		Passive v Active voice
			Passive
				The pen (subject) was (verb, primary auxiliary) thrown (past participle) by him.(agent)
				The pen was thrown (agentless passive)
				The pen is thrown. (present perfect)
			Active
				He (subject) threw (verb) the pen (object).
				He throws the pen. 
		Types of verbs
			Dynamic v Stative
				Dynamic verbs are actions
				Stative verbs are feelings
			Transitive v Intransitive v Copular
				Verbs can be copular, transitive, or intransitive
			Auxiliary (primary) (modal) and Lexical verb
			Finite v Non-finite (based on form)
			Phrasal
				These are verbs that change their meaning when linked with a preposition or adverb in a phrase that can’t be split eg. The salesman looked up the prices.  / I always looked up to her. /The baby has gone off her food. He is carrying on about it. (usage: some, but not all, phrasal verbs are colloquial) 
		Tense forms
			Present tense
			Simple past tense
			Aspects 
				Perfect 
				Continuous
			Past/present continuous
				Ongoing action
			Past/present perfect
				Completed accent
			infinitive
			Basic
	Adjectives
		Meaning
			These are traditionally known as describing words, that give us extra information about nouns. 
			Adjectives can make descriptions more specific, with details about age, colour etc.
			In texts, adjectives can help to create a particular tone. 
			Adjectives may be used to enhance a persuasive function eg. in advertising or political language.
		Form
			-able 	eg. presentable
			-al  	eg magical
			-ful  	eg. wonderful
			-ic 	eg. metric
				tends to be words that can only be expressed as a adjective
				noun to adjective
			-ish 	eg. childish
				noun to adjective
			-ive 	eg. expressive
			-less 	eg. helpless
				usually verb to adjective, can be noun to adjective
			-ous 	eg. mysterious
				noun to adjective
			-y 	eg. snowy
				noun to adjective
			Some adjectives can be graded so that items can be compared or put in context in relation to others. For many adjectives this can be done by adding the morphemes –er or -est:
				big bigger (comparative) biggest (superlative)
			Or most or more is added before the subject
			Irregular verbs
				bad -  worse  - worst
				good – better – best
			Other structures in English can be used to compare adjectives 
				As… as  (Jane is as tall as me. His eyes were as cold as ice.)
				Less (You are less busy than me these days.)
				Less … least	(Jane is less confident than me but Mel is the least confident of the three of us.)
				Some adjectives aren’t really comparable – they are absolute. For instance, semantically, you can’t have degrees of silence.
		Function
			An adjective can go in front of a noun in a noun phrase
				I wanted (sunny weather).
			An adjective can function as the head of an Adjective Phrase as part of a complement, coming after a copular verb but describing either subject or object
				The weather was (sunny).		The woman seemed (quite shy). 
			An adjective may have an intensifying adverb in front of it e.g. very / so / quite / really / unbearably
				The weather was (very sunny). 
			An adjective may stand alone after the verb or in parenthesis after a noun phrase (shown by bracketing commas or brackets or dashes) to describe the subject
				The lecturer stood, (tall and straight), waiting for silence. 
				The girl, (sad), sat by herself.
			Sometimes an adjective can follow a noun to show something specific about that noun. This is less common usage
				(The people present) enjoyed the show.
				(The man responsible) is a fraud.
			Sometimes a verb can do the job of an adjective
				the (running) boy
			Sometimes a noun can do the job of an adjective
				the (garden) wall
		Types of adjectives
			Modifier
			Attributive and predicative
			Comparative and superlative
			Copular verb
	Adverbs
		Meaning
			Traditionally an adverb is a word that modifies a verb. Some adverbs do this but this word class does more than this. Adverbs are modifying words that can give all sorts of extra information within a sentence, from details about time and place to expressing degree or suggesting an attitude.
				Modifying a verb: The bird flew (slowly).
				Modifying an adjective: The man was (very strong).
				Modifying other adverbs: He threw the bag (quite roughly) at me.
				Expressing an attitude to or modifying a sentence or clause: I certainly will be there. / I went home; my friend, meanwhile, stayed to chat.
		Form
			Circumstance adverbs (adjuncts)
				Tells us about time, manner or place
					Time
						I can't come now. I might come later.
					Manner
						I slept well. / He ate greedily
					Frequency
						I always come to your house. You never come here.
					Place
						the boy ran up upstairs. I walked there
						Information of where a verb physically occurs
						Can be confused with prepositions
						I fell down (adverb)
						I fell down the stairs (preposition)
							prepositions describe a noun
			Degree adverbs
				Modify adverbs or adjectives
				very / really / so etc. 
			Sentence adverbs
				Modify a whole sentence. Disjuncts express attitudes / show a comment on what is being said; conjuncts can be used to link sentences. 
				Disjunct
					 Surely this isn’t your best? Honestly, I think it’s rubbish.  Other disjuncts include: fortunately, actually, oddly, perhaps, etc.
				Conjunct
					 Firstly, I’m leaving; however, I’ll send you a postcard. Other connecting adverbs include: so, yet, however, therefore, secondly, though (note these overlap with the conjunction word class)
			Many adverbs are formed by adding the suffix –ly to an adjective
				loud – loudly / tidy – tidily / severe – severely / gentle - gently
			Comparatives and superlative forms are either formed with the –er and –est suffixes, or with more / most.
				early – earlier – earliest
				Loudly – more loudly – most loudly 
				Certainly – most certainly
			Some adverbs are irregular
			badly – worse – worst / well - better – best
			Much – more – most / little – less - least
		Function
			Adverbs of manner may modify a specific verb, as part of an adverb phrase.
				I ran very quickly.
			Adverbs of degree, that moderate or intensify an adverb or adjective or verb usually go before that word.
				I really love you. / I barely know you. 
			Adverbs of time, place, degree or disjuncts can often go either at the front of the sentence, after the first auxiliary verb, before the main verb, or at the end of the sentence.
				I actually am fifty-three.
				I am actually fifty-three. 
				Actually, I’m fifty-three.  (disjunct)
				I’m fifty-three actually.
			Distinguishing Between Adverbs and Adjectives Where the Word Looks the Same
				Think about what word is being modified and look at the word order. 
					The early train: early is modifying ‘train’ = adjective
					The train was early: answering the question when / in what manner? = adverb
					I tried hard: ‘hard’ tells us to what degree I worked = adverb
					The work was too hard: hard here is describing the noun work (functioning as a subject complement) = adjective
Closed Word Classes
	Pronouns
		Meaning
			The traditional definition of a pronoun is that it replaces a noun or a noun phrase. 
		Form
			There are seven forms of pronouns. 
				Personal pronouns
					Subject: I, you, he, she, we, you, they
					Object: me, you, him, her, us, you, them
				Possessive pronouns (sometimes called genitive)
					mine, yours, his, hers, ours, yours, theirs
				Reflexive pronouns 
					myself, yourself, himself, herself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves
				Demonstrative pronouns
					They point to something (deictic function)
						This and these – points to something that is close to the speaker
						That and those – points to something that is further away, or not immediately present
				Relative pronouns
					these introduce a relative clause.
						Which, that, who, whom, whose
						The apples (which were mouldy) infected the others in the bowl.
				Interrogative pronouns
					these are used to ask questions. (note: some of these overlap with relative pronouns)
						who, which, what, whom, whose
				Indefinite pronouns
					these have a less certain reference point. 
						of’ pronouns: all of, both of, each of, either of, neither of, some of. These can be followed by a noun, an object pronoun or a relative pronoun. eg. I want all of the books. I want all of them. I want the two books, both of which have been recommended.
				Compound pronouns
					 everything, something, anything, nothing, everybody, somebody, anybody, nobody
	Determiners
		Meaning
			Determiners precedes a noun and provides information about the nature of the noun. 
			Many words are both pronouns and determiners. Remember, pronouns replace, determiners precede.
		Form
			Articles:
				including the definite (the) and indefinite article (a/an)
			Possessive determiners: these suggest ownership of a noun (part of what some grammars call a genitive construction)
				 my, his, her, its, your, our, their. Eg. my book, their motive.
			Demonstrative determiners: the same as the list for demonstrative pronouns, they specify the relationship of the object to other objects. 
				eg. this book. 
			Indefinite determiners
				some, any, no; every, each, either, neither, one, another; both, several, enough; many, more, most, few, little, fewer, less, fewest, least.
			Numbers
				some grammars refer to these as another word class, enumerators – Thorne doesn’t use this definition.
			Enumerators
				Cardinal numbers (one, two, three etc)
				Ordinal numbers (first, second, third…)
				A few general ordinals (next, last, other, further)
	Prepositions
		Meaning
			These introduce prepositional phrases, and express relationships between elements of sentences.
		Form
			Place
				at, on, by, opposite
			Direction
				towards, past, out of, to, through
			Time
				at, before, in, on
			Comparison
				as…as, like
			Source
				from, out of
			Purpose
				for
			There's a overlap between prepositions and adverb, particularly adverbs of place or direction
				I crawled through the wire = introducing a PP = preposition
				I crawled through = answering the question ‘where?’ and modifying the verb = adverb 
		Overlap
			Sometimes a word looks like a preposition but it may be functioning differently in the context of a sentence. 
				I knocked on the door. = preposition (place)
				I kicked in the door = ‘in’ there is part of a verb phrase ‘kicked in’
			Thorne refers to this as a ‘particle’.
	Conjunctions
		Meaning
			These may introduce phrases or clauses, or may combine or connect phrases or clauses. 
		Form
			Some grammars use the acronym 'Fanboys'
				For, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. 
				Coordinating conjunctions
			This can include neither...nor / either...or which allows us to create alternatives; and can intensify the meaning or add additional details
		Coordinating 
			Function
				Link words together
					I don't like sweetcorn (or) peas
					She was pale (and) delicate
				Link phrases together
					I have (neither) black trousers (nor) a red shirt
				Link independent clauses
					We went to town (and) we saw a film (but) we didn’t eat out (or) have a drink.
		Subordinating
			Form
				They create a range of connections:
					Time
						when(ever), while, as, before, until, till, after, since, once, when
					Place
						 where, wherever
					Purpose or result
						so, so that, in order that
					Reason
						 because, as, since
					Condition
						if, unless, whether, supposing, in case
					Contrast
						although, while, whereas
					Comparison
						as, than, like, as if, as though
					Concession
						although, if, whereas
			Function
				Subordinating conjunctions link things together that don’t have the same grammatical status. They can link dependent grammatical units that don’t make sense by themselves to independent units that can stand alone.
					I like ebooks (independent)	because I can download them easily. (dependent)
					If I love the sun (dependent)	I should prefer summer to winter. (independent)
					I went to town (independent) so that I could sort out the Christmas shopping. (dependent)
			Overlap
				There’s some overlap here (e.g. the words after, before, since, until, till.)
				Look at the function. A subordinator will always be followed by a groups of words with a finite or non-finite verb. A preposition will be followed by a noun, a determiner+noun, or a pronoun.
					He always has a shower after the match. (prep + determiner + noun)
					He always has a shower after he plays football. (conjunction + subject + verb)
					I got dressed before breakfast. = prep+ noun
					Before having my breakfast, I got dressed.  = conj + sub + verb
