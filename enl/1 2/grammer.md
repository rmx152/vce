Morphology 
	Study of the rules which govern the ways in which morphemes form words
		Words can consist of one morpheme (cat/travel)
		Or more than one morpheme (cat-s/travel(l)-er)
	Words are composed of similar meaningful units. The smallest meaningful unit can't be divided any further without severely altering the meaning
		Strange, asparagus, and cardigan cannot be broken down
	Types of morphemes
			Free morpheme
				Can stand by itself
				Does not need anything else to provide meaning
					Travel
			Bound morpheme
				It cannot occur on its own
				It needs another morpheme to make sense
					-ed
			Complex words
					More than one morpheme that consists of a stem (major component of word meaning) and one or more affixes, which are bound to the base form
						This can be referred to as content or lexical morphemes and function morphemes 
			Compound morpheme
				Both words make sense
					Doghouse
	Affixes
		Prefix
			Morpheme goes in front
		Suffix
			Morpheme goes on end
		Infix
			Morpheme goes inside the word 

Word classes
	Nouns
		Meaning
			Classed as 'naming words' 
				Names for things, places, people, places
			Can also be abstract concepts
				Emotions, activities, and states
					Business, joy, calculations, philosophy
		Form
			Many concrete nouns take inflections to show number (singular and plural) – this is often the –s (ies / es) morpheme. This is complicated, though: some nouns take no plural (eg. sheep) there are also some irregular nouns that add a different suffix (eg child – children) or change altogether for plurals (eg mouse – mice); possessive (often called genitive). 
			Some nouns for emotions or abstract nouns may be derived from other word classes by suffixes such as:   - ness, -(i)ty, -er, -ment, -ion.
			Many nouns also take a possessive –’s  (this may vary to agree with number eg. the boy’s (1 boy); the boys’ (more than 1 boy)
		Function and Behaviour
			Nouns can function as
				The head word
					a noun phrase may function in the clause as subject, object or complement
						Comes after the verb, describes the subject 
							e.g Om studies (a lot)
						Copular verbs
							Links a subject to a complement
					e.g The (determiner) really (adverb) good (adjective) Jayesh (head word)
					Modifiers
						A word giving more information to another word
					e.g Suzanne Cory High School
						Suzanne Cory (noun acting as a modifier) High School (noun)
				Genitive phrases
					eg. My bag
				Prepositional phrases
					eg. In the box
					eg. (In (the classroom) noun phrase) prepositional phrase
				Modify a head word
					eg. A girl's school, the bread knife, the nun who gave Maria a guitar
			Replaced by a pronoun
				A pronoun may be the Head word in a Noun Phrase. 
				Pronouns have a range of forms and inflections  
					eg. (Jane) (left) (school) could be replaced by (She) (left) (school)
