Discourse and pragmatics
	Discourse and pragmatics involve using the immediate context of language to help understand what it means. 
	When we look at discourse, we’re analysing the way the text is constructed as a whole.
		We look at how the text is organised so that the language makes sense for the audience.
		We look at the text type and the structure that you would expect for a particular text type (eg web page, email, poem, formal speech).
		We look at the ways in which the writer or speaker considers what their intended audience may already know, and what they expect them to infer in order to make sense of the text.
		We look at how cohesive the text is - what links and connections are built into the language so that the text can be followed easily.
	Text Structure and Organisation
		We can look at the ways in which the following elements help to build coherence and cohesion in a written text:
			Headings, subheadings
			Bullet points
			Images 
			Different fonts, italicisation, bold type for emphasis
			Numbered points or paragraphs
		The more planned and edited a text is, the more coherent (organised) you would expect it to be. 
		Example: Websites
			the use of headings, subheadings and section headings that function as links
			the position and role of images
			the use of corporate, institutional and social media logos
			the use of visually separate sections and bulleted or numbered lists
			the use of fonts and bold, italicised and underlined type.
			the way semantic domain (use of words with related meanings) can help create cohesion (hold the text together)
		Example: Legal Texts
			use of headings and subheadings
			the use of syntax – legal documents often contain compound and complex sentence structures in which components refer backwards and forwards to each other (cohesion – anaphoric and cataphoric reference* you don’t need to know this metalanguage until year 12)
			semantic patterning (use of lots of words from the same legal or business-related semantic field)
	Coherence and Cohesion using Language
		All of the features that make a text logical, organised and easy to follow support the coherence of a text.
		In addition, a planned and edited text should be cohesive. This means that within a text, there will be features that make connections between parts of a text
			Repetition
			Syntactic patterns like parallelism, where the same phrase, clause or sentence structure is repeated
			Adverbs to suggest time or sequence, eg. First, … Finally
			Pronouns that prevent the writer from having to keep repeating names - that link back to earlier references in the text. This is called anaphoric reference.
