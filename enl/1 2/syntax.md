Types of Phrases
	Noun phrases (NP)
		Form
			A noun phrase will usually consist of either a noun or a pronoun as the head word. 
			The head word may be on its own; for concepts (happiness) or proper nouns (Jane) or some pronouns (She).
			The head word in a noun phrase can also be an adjective which is functioning as a noun; the old / the beautiful / the wise. 
				Note with these words the form is adjectival; the way they behave in the phrase is more like a noun, and in terms of meaning, referring to groups in this way focuses our attention on their qualities rather than the individuals within the groups.
			There may be other words before (pre-modification) or after (post-modification) the head word. 
			Pre-modification
				For concrete nouns, there’s often a determiner as the first modifier in the phrase
					 eg. (the dog) / (some food) / (two books). 
				There may be one or more adjectives modifying the noun 
					eg. (the brown dog).
				There may be adverbs that modify the adjectives in the noun phrase for instance (the very cranky bear) – here the adverb very modifies the adjective cranky.
				Example
					Eg. (a particularly obnoxious child)
					Eg. (the dirty old white car)
					Eg. (seven fat brown hens)
					Eg. (an extremely expensive shiny red dress)
					Eg. (the first female president)
			Post-modification
				There may be a prepositional phrase post-modifying the Head noun:
					Eg. (the actor (from Game of Thrones))
					Eg. (the man (at the centre (of the group)))
				There may be a Relative Clause modifying the noun. Look out for the square brackets to denote a clause within this phrase as your example of this:
					(The bear [that escaped from the zoo] )
				Non-finite clauses (beginning with a participle [-ing, -ed] or an infinitive [to verb]) can also post-modify noun phrases.
					The student avoiding his homework
					The girl scared of snakes
					The way to drive home
		Functions
			Within a clause, NPs can function as: 
				subject 
					eg. (The cat) sat. (She) ran. 
				*object* (direct object or indirect object)
					eg. (The cat) ate (*the meat*).   (I) gave (*the cat*) (*some food*).  (The cat) scratched (*me*).
				or **complement** (subject or object complement)
					eg. (The cat) is (**a tabby**).
					Eg.   (I) named (*the cat*) (**Baz**).
			Noun phrases can be placed in apposition.
				Eg, Fred, my neighbour, is 84 today.
			Analysing Noun Phrases
				Some text types (legal language, for example, or some literary forms) use heavily modified noun phrases. This can a useful aspect of texts to analyse to look at how the language is functioning (for example, in a novel where the scene is being set) and also as a marker of complexity in the language (for example, in a legal text where every possible interpretation of a law needs to be listed and covered). 
	Verb phrases (VP)
		Form
			A verb phrase consists of a main verb (the head word in the verb phrase). 
			A verb phrase may also consist of up to four auxiliary verbs.
			A verb phrase may incorporate another word in order to form a negative. 
				eg. I would *never* eat a horse.  / He should *not* do that. / I had*n’t* been planning a meal.
			In interrogatives and imperatives, the order of words in the verb phrase structure may be varied. We often use the auxiliary ‘do’ or ‘have’ to help form these sentence types:
				Eg. Why did you come?    / Where do you come from ?  / Have you finished? Do take a seat.
		Function
			These function as the verb element in a clause. 
	Adverb phrases (AvP)
		Form
			The head of an adverb phrase is an adverb. Otherwise the structure is the same as with adjective phrases, with pre- and post- modification:
				Eg. (very quickly)
				Eg. (rather too quickly for comfort)
				Eg. (more quickly   PP(than last year))
		Function
			These function in a clause as adverbials.
	Adjective phrases (AjP)
		Form
			The head of an adjective phrase is an adjective. Premodifiers are always adverbs, especially adverbs of degree (very, rather, extremely etc.) Adjectives that precede nouns as part of a noun phrase are attributive. Adjectives that follow nouns (often after a copular verb) are predicative and are the head words of adjective phrases.
			There is usually a head word and either pre- or post- modification, or both. 
				He is (fiercely competitive).
				The room was (quite unbelievably crowded)
				You’ve spent (quite long enough) on that homework.  Here ‘long’ is the head word in the phrase
			Post-modification can be by another phrase. 
				My dog is (large PP(for a whippet)).
				It’s (taller PP(than two metres)).
			Or post-modification can be by a clause.
				the game was (fun [to play])  
				(so enchanting [that he accepted her offer])
		Function
			Adjective phrases can function within noun phrases, as modifiers:
				I ate (a (very *stale*) slice of bread)
			Adjective phrases can function to create comparatives:
				This is less *heavy*.
				Mary is *taller*.   					(These examples are complements)
			Adjective phrases can function as shortened (verbless) clauses, where ellipsis is assumed:
				I looked at his face, *dirty* and *scratched*. 
			Adjective phrases can function as an object or subject complement:
				He made her *happy* (object)
				I pushed the door *open*.   (object)
				The dog was *large*.   (subject)
	Prepositional phrases (PP)
		Form
			These behave like noun phrases, but with a preposition at the beginning of them to indicated direction, positioning or other relationships.
				(By Monday) we had arrived (by train) (in Sydney).
		Function
			These behave as adverbials in clauses.  They can also post-modify noun phrases, adjective phrases and adverb phrases.
