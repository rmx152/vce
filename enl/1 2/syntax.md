Types of Phrases
	Noun phrases (NP)
		Form
			A noun phrase will usually consist of either a noun or a pronoun as the head word. 
			The head word may be on its own; for concepts (happiness) or proper nouns (Jane) or some pronouns (She).
			The head word in a noun phrase can also be an adjective which is functioning as a noun; the old / the beautiful / the wise. 
				Note with these words the form is adjectival; the way they behave in the phrase is more like a noun, and in terms of meaning, referring to groups in this way focuses our attention on their qualities rather than the individuals within the groups.
			There may be other words before (pre-modification) or after (post-modification) the head word. 
			Pre-modification
				For concrete nouns, there’s often a determiner as the first modifier in the phrase
					 eg. (the dog) / (some food) / (two books). 
				There may be one or more adjectives modifying the noun 
					eg. (the brown dog).
				There may be adverbs that modify the adjectives in the noun phrase for instance (the very cranky bear) – here the adverb very modifies the adjective cranky.
				Example
					Eg. (a particularly obnoxious child)
					Eg. (the dirty old white car)
					Eg. (seven fat brown hens)
					Eg. (an extremely expensive shiny red dress)
					Eg. (the first female president)
			Post-modification
				There may be a prepositional phrase post-modifying the Head noun:
					Eg. (the actor (from Game of Thrones))
					Eg. (the man (at the centre (of the group)))
				There may be a Relative Clause modifying the noun. Look out for the square brackets to denote a clause within this phrase as your example of this:
					(The bear [that escaped from the zoo] )
				Non-finite clauses (beginning with a participle [-ing, -ed] or an infinitive [to verb]) can also post-modify noun phrases.
					The student avoiding his homework
					The girl scared of snakes
					The way to drive home
		Functions
			Within a clause, NPs can function as: 
				subject 
					eg. (The cat) sat. (She) ran. 
				*object* (direct object or indirect object)
					eg. (The cat) ate (*the meat*).   (I) gave (*the cat*) (*some food*).  (The cat) scratched (*me*).
				or **complement** (subject or object complement)
					eg. (The cat) is (**a tabby**).
					Eg.   (I) named (*the cat*) (**Baz**).
			Noun phrases can be placed in apposition.
				Eg, Fred, my neighbour, is 84 today.
			Analysing Noun Phrases
				Some text types (legal language, for example, or some literary forms) use heavily modified noun phrases. This can a useful aspect of texts to analyse to look at how the language is functioning (for example, in a novel where the scene is being set) and also as a marker of complexity in the language (for example, in a legal text where every possible interpretation of a law needs to be listed and covered).
