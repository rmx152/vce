Types of Phrases
	Noun phrases (NP)
		Form
			A noun phrase will usually consist of either a noun or a pronoun as the head word. 
			The head word may be on its own; for concepts (happiness) or proper nouns (Jane) or some pronouns (She).
			The head word in a noun phrase can also be an adjective which is functioning as a noun; the old / the beautiful / the wise. 
				Note with these words the form is adjectival; the way they behave in the phrase is more like a noun, and in terms of meaning, referring to groups in this way focuses our attention on their qualities rather than the individuals within the groups.
			There may be other words before (pre-modification) or after (post-modification) the head word. 
			Pre-modification
				For concrete nouns, there’s often a determiner as the first modifier in the phrase
					 eg. (the dog) / (some food) / (two books). 
				There may be one or more adjectives modifying the noun 
					eg. (the brown dog).
				There may be adverbs that modify the adjectives in the noun phrase for instance (the very cranky bear) – here the adverb very modifies the adjective cranky.
				Example
					eg. (a particularly obnoxious child)
					eg. (the dirty old white car)
					eg. (seven fat brown hens)
					eg. (an extremely expensive shiny red dress)
					eg. (the first female president)
			Post-modification
				There may be a prepositional phrase post-modifying the Head noun:
					eg. (the actor (from Game of Thrones))
					eg. (the man (at the centre (of the group)))
				There may be a Relative Clause modifying the noun. Look out for the square brackets to denote a clause within this phrase as your example of this:
					(The bear [that escaped from the zoo] )
				Non-finite clauses (beginning with a participle [-ing, -ed] or an infinitive [to verb]) can also post-modify noun phrases.
					The student avoiding his homework
					The girl scared of snakes
					The way to drive home
		Functions
			Within a clause, NPs can function as: 
				subject 
					eg. (The cat) sat. (She) ran. 
				*object* (direct object or indirect object)
					eg. (The cat) ate (*the meat*).   (I) gave (*the cat*) (*some food*).  (The cat) scratched (*me*).
				or **complement** (subject or object complement)
					eg. (The cat) is (**a tabby**).
					eg.   (I) named (*the cat*) (**Baz**).
			Noun phrases can be placed in apposition.
				eg. Fred, my neighbour, is 84 today.
			Analysing Noun Phrases
				Some text types (legal language, for example, or some literary forms) use heavily modified noun phrases. This can a useful aspect of texts to analyse to look at how the language is functioning (for example, in a novel where the scene is being set) and also as a marker of complexity in the language (for example, in a legal text where every possible interpretation of a law needs to be listed and covered). 
	Verb phrases (VP)
		Form
			A verb phrase consists of a main verb (the head word in the verb phrase). 
			A verb phrase may also consist of up to four auxiliary verbs.
			A verb phrase may incorporate another word in order to form a negative. 
				eg. I would *never* eat a horse.  / He should *not* do that. / I had*n’t* been planning a meal.
			In interrogatives and imperatives, the order of words in the verb phrase structure may be varied. We often use the auxiliary ‘do’ or ‘have’ to help form these sentence types:
				eg. Why did you come?    / Where do you come from ?  / Have you finished? Do take a seat.
		Function
			These function as the verb element in a clause. 
	Adverb phrases (AvP)
		Form
			The head of an adverb phrase is an adverb. Otherwise the structure is the same as with adjective phrases, with pre- and post- modification:
				eg. (very quickly)
				eg. (rather too quickly for comfort)
				eg. (more quickly   PP(than last year))
		Function
			These function in a clause as adverbials.
	Adjective phrases (AjP)
		Form
			The head of an adjective phrase is an adjective. Premodifiers are always adverbs, especially adverbs of degree (very, rather, extremely etc.) Adjectives that precede nouns as part of a noun phrase are attributive. Adjectives that follow nouns (often after a copular verb) are predicative and are the head words of adjective phrases.
			There is usually a head word and either pre- or post- modification, or both. 
				He is (fiercely competitive).
				The room was (quite unbelievably crowded)
				You’ve spent (quite long enough) on that homework.  Here ‘long’ is the head word in the phrase
			Post-modification can be by another phrase. 
				My dog is (large PP(for a whippet)).
				It’s (taller PP(than two metres)).
			Or post-modification can be by a clause.
				the game was (fun [to play])  
				(so enchanting [that he accepted her offer])
		Function
			Adjective phrases can function within noun phrases, as modifiers:
				I ate (a (very *stale*) slice of bread)
			Adjective phrases can function to create comparatives:
				This is less *heavy*.
				Mary is *taller*.   					(These examples are complements)
			Adjective phrases can function as shortened (verbless) clauses, where ellipsis is assumed:
				I looked at his face, *dirty* and *scratched*. 
			Adjective phrases can function as an object or subject complement:
				He made her *happy* (object)
				I pushed the door *open*.   (object)
				The dog was *large*.   (subject)
	Prepositional phrases (PP)
		Form
			These behave like noun phrases, but with a preposition at the beginning of them to indicated direction, positioning or other relationships.
				(By Monday) we had arrived (by train) (in Sydney).
		Function
			These behave as adverbials in clauses.  They can also post-modify noun phrases, adjective phrases and adverb phrases.
Sentence structure
	Coordination
		I ate (the bread [that you bought for me])
	Subordination
		I ate (the bread) and (the cheese) 
	Simple
		Needs to have a finite verb
		Known as a Main Clause
		Examples
			The cat sat on the mat
			The guests arrived
			She seemed angry
			The cook made a larger stew for the evening meal
	Sentence fragment
		Some sentences don't have a full clause with all the required elements. Usually this is where a verb is missing
		They are often used in advertising, where syntax is shortened to get the message across quickly
			Going well!! (going is a non-finite verb)
	Compound
		A compound sentecne contains two or more main caluses linked by coordinating conunctions
		FANBOYS
			for
			and
			nor
			but
			or
			yet
			so
		Each clause in a compound sentence that could stand on its own and carries equal weight. This is a coordination.
		Examples
			[The boy ate his dinner] and [he cleared the table]
			[We could go to the park] or [we could visit the museum]
			[Diya is good at English] but [she prefers English Language]
		Substitution and Ellipsis
			In a compound sentence the noun may be replaced by a pronoun in the second clause
				[Dickens wrote many novels in his lifetime] and [he is still popular]
	Complex
		A complex sentence has one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses. A subordinate clause can't stand on its own as a grammatical sentence. 
		These are various types of subordinate clauses based on their functions within the sentences
			I went to the shops because I was hungry
			I called my mother to wish her happy birthday
			If I go now, I will miss all the fun
			Running for the bus, I tripped over
			It was my girlfriend who did my homework
	Compound-Complex
		If a sentence contains both coordination and subordination, then it is a compound-complex sentence
			Because Jill fell over, her knee was sore and she needed a bandage
			I wen to the kitchen to make a snack and ate a sandwich
			The window broke when the ball smashed through it, so Pranav pretended that he had been inside the whole time
