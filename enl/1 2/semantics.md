Semantics
	Meaning and sign
		Knowing a language means knowing that a certain sign (also known in some theory as a signifier) is connected to a particular meaning (also known as the signified).
		We know from unit 1 that the connection between sign and meaning is arbitrary (ie there is no connection between the sound in most words and the meaning; different languages use different signifiers).
		Semantic terms
			Synonymy 
				words that have similar meanings (roughly – no lexeme will have an identical meaning to another). Some may be more formal ways of saying things (often a Latinate or French- or Greek-derived word may do this).
			Antonymy 
				words that have opposite meanings (again, roughly).
			Hyponymy
				this is related to the hierarchies between certain word groups, for instance the term ‘vehicle’ can cover ‘car’, ‘scooter’, ‘bus’ etc. Here, ‘vehicle’ is the hypernym (the more general term)and the other words are hyponyms. 
			Idiom / idiomatic
				Commonly used phrases with non-literal meanings
				Usually colloquial 
				eg. 'out of the blue' : Unexpected event
			Euphemism
				A word or phrase that is used to soften to mask a difficult or taboo subject
			Dysphemism
				A word or phrase that is deliberately used to emphasise a taboo topic, deliberately  causing offence or a humorous purposes. Swear-words are often used dysphemistically, sometimes to deliberate shock or offend but also for humour
			Subsystem of semantics
				Etymology 
					How words and their meanings change over time
				Word formation processes 
					broadening 
						increases in range of meanings
					narrowing
						decreases in range of meanings
					elevation
						connotations become positive
					deterioration
						connotations become negative
					shift
						meaning has changed
				Denotation
					Literal meaning
				Connotation
					associations
						Cultural
						Social
						Established within groups
						Individual to a particular speaker
			Semantic domain
				A semantic domain in a text is a set of words that have related meanings that refer to a specific subject or topic. A single text can contain more than one semantic domain. The semantic domain helps the text achieve coherence and be understood by the participants.
