Register
	This involves language variation that is defined by use (as opposed to dialects, sociolects, etc. that refer to language variation defined by user); registers involve features across a range of subsystems
	Registers are marked by distinctive grammatical features
Tenor
	This refers to the relationships between participants in a language activity and relates especially to social distance. It also involves the level of formality participants adopt (formal, colloquial, etc.). Tenor will be affected by how well people know each other and their purpose for participation.
	Tenor describes how the relationship between the participants influences the way language is being used.
	Questions to consider:
		? How does the language reflect the degree of intimacy versus distance of the participants?
		? How does the language reflect the hierarchy in which the participants are situated?
		? How does the language used reflect rapport between participants?
		? How is the language impacted by the authority of the speakers?
Audience
